   Never expected to write a negative review for OnePlus Product !1. Screen Flickering is the most common problem2. Half of the times, TV doesn't start with a single button press.3. Booting takes atleast 20 seconds4. Screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time.5. Audio is dud - Not sufficient for my 10X10 ft bedroom6. System lag is the maximum in this class of TV'sEdit: 23/07/2020Amazon declined to replace and offered refund of 19,600/- as against 23k which I paid for the TV. All I have to do now is to live with a defective TV, as I had invested in the wallmount and the allied services. OnePlus SettledEdit: 27/07/2020Product is back in stock. Amazon accepted for replacement after technician report. But, defective product is yet to be picked up and the replacement is yet to be shipped. Awaiting further details. Brand is not at all acting in the customers interest. Very bad response for OnePlus.Edit: 6/8/2020Received the replacement TV from Amazon and the TV if working fine as of now.

1,"TV is beautiful with minute bezels.I was pleased by the picture quality in firstI expected a smooth software from oneplus but TV operation is bit slow probably due to 1gb ram and lower clocked processor. Can't complaint at this price point. Wish oneplus would release better optimized software in update. Software update was one of my reason to buy TV from oneplus.Response from the bluetooth remote was bit slow.But hold bluetooth was very functional. Might be as it is bluetooth 5.0, TV was able to connect to 3+ devices at a time. 1 mobile, 1 bluetooth speaker and remote. That's great.Coming to sound, Speaker quality isn't upto mark. You have multiple options to enhance audio (dolby, surround, presets, dialogue enhancer etc) probably that's the reason oneplus skipped 3.5mm output and opted for optical and HDMI ARC ports to provide quality auido output on external speaker. You should go RCA audio adapters if you want 3.5mm input else connect to speakers using bluetooth adapter. That would cost additional if you want to.If you look for picture quality, minimal design and stick to few ott app this TV is for you.For power users and those who use only 3.5 jack to connect speakers look else where.Update :Oneplus released major update and UI and remote control navigation seems improved now.But setup of new Bluetooth connection got buggy.

2,"ere is my experience with the Oneplus LAGGY tv32Y model. Here is a list of issues with your product.1. connected to Samsung mobile through google home as the tv isn't connecting through Samsung smart view. always says unable to connect, try again. And even through the google home, it is struggling too much to even cast the photos and forget about casting the videos.2. Neither windows nor Mac is recognising The tv in wireless mode. Had to use third party app from play store to Airplay my Mac n gues what, windows is not recognising the tv. It is really shocking to see Mac recognised where Windows couldn’t (using third party play store app).3. To my bad, even through third party play store app, it is laggy half of the times.4. And how can I ignore to say about Oneplus connect app, Its a wonders**t app, do the gesture wait for couple of seconds and then it responds and you can’t access files through the connect app on this tv.5. And sound, it has options by the name, dolby Audio and Dolby digital plus, fix this in your mind, these two features are just names and these does change the sound experience by zero percentage.6. On Youtube, video quality is limited to 1080p, best to use HDMi cable to your happy and play 4K, only then it felt better than any other video quality experience of this tv.7. Opening and closing apps, is like suspense thriller movie scene experience, you will be waiting to know when it will respond.sometimes suspense extends to 3-10 seconds.8. Viewing angles? acceptable for this price.9. Colors? Green is worst of all and then red , black is good, blue colors are worst, yellows are good and the rest that you find are acceptable.10. Display quality? If any of you ever used the Chinese phones of the last decade, you will get the exact same feeling. I promise you this.11. Best option to put  good use of display and colors is to use pen drive, hard disk or HDMI and play the 4k or full HD videos. This is the only way that this display can make you happy.12. And the remote, the menu button literally never worked on  any app nor on home page. It just exists with void function assigned to it.13. Almost forgot about voice search that is google assistance, 10 out of 10 times, it took 3-10 seconds to launch it.14. Opening an app, Fix in your mind that it will take at least 3-10.15. Once you connect Bluetooth accessory, you have to remove the device from the list, if you want to connect it to other device. you will not have an option to disconnect.",ere experience oneplus laggy tv32y model list issue product1 connected samsung mobile google home tv isnt connecting samsung smart view always say unable connect try even google home struggling much even cast photo forget casting videos2 neither window mac recognising tv wireless mode use third party app play store airplay mac n gues window recognising tv really shocking see mac recognised window couldnt using third party play store app3 bad even third party play store app laggy half times4 ignore say oneplus connect app wonderst app gesture wait couple second responds cant access file connect app tv5 sound option name dolby audio dolby digital plus fix mind two feature name change sound experience zero percentage6 youtube video quality limited 1080p best use hdmi cable happy play 4k felt better video quality experience tv7 opening closing apps like suspense thriller movie scene experience waiting know respondsometimes suspense extends 310 seconds8 viewing angle acceptable price9 color green worst red black good blue color worst yellow good rest find acceptable10 display quality ever used chinese phone last decade get exact feeling promise this11 best option put good use display color use pen drive hard disk hdmi play 4k full hd video way display make happy12 remote menu button literally never worked app home page exists void function assigned it13 almost forgot voice search google assistance 10 10 time took 310 second launch it14 opening app fix mind take least 31015 connect bluetooth accessory remove device list want connect device option disconnect,0.04771825396825395

5,"First to review 43y1, as my experience with 43 inch So far i liked the Tv.Tv is by default on energy saving picture mode, change to desire mode to get best picture experience, as i changed many picture settings the picture quality is way better than MI & realme me.Sound quality for my living room is more than enough, dolby atmos work carm with my Tatasky HD channels as they support dolby audio.The Lag is fixed to much extent.last input memory is also fixed, TV remembers the last input before switching off.The installation was bit crisp as the guy didn't turn on the promised date, so amazon escalated and yesterday new guy came and installated.Cherry on the cake the installation was free also the wall mount bracket worth Rs500 was provided free by the installation team.Installed and the demo was given very promptly.Also to be noted this 43 inches has different graphic processor than 32 inches G51 Mp3Updating my experience of 4 days -Experienced lag nly twice in 4 days.TV takes a approx of 1 min to get ON.There's a bit motion blur, which would be fixed by update, as it arises due to the DNR in the settings.Sound output is overall good at this range can't expect soundbar like bass.Pre-Book extended warranty has been activated and mail confirmation received from acko.Picture quality is just awesome, with setting proper backlight, contrast etc.Blacks are properly seen black.This has VA panel and i am not much concerned about viewing angles. VA Panels are best for the straight view angle as they produce good contrast and color reproduction,this TV does the same.Viewing angle can't be reviewed from my end as I did see blur when viewd at 150 angle which is obvious for VA panel.Data saver option and alexa support is yet to be updated in this TV.As of now no alexa support for this TV as there's no option to login to oneplus account, so my free echo dot is not of use with this TV as of now, may be they will provide the update to this.Updating my review with some test done1) RGB colour gamat test is performing perfectly on this TV. As you can see computer rgb reproduce proper color.2)motion blur is too much in this TV, expect to be fix via update.3) TV remote is Bluetooth and IR both, i turned of my bluetooth of Remote and using on IR as it's draining battery, when on IR you can't use Google assistant function.4) No support for Echo dot as of now confirmed, hopefully will be in update.5) No data saver option yet.6) backlight bleeding is present at 10% which is common for LED Tv.7) color reproduction is good too.Updating my review to some clarification and my experience 26/071) As echo dot is not compatible and no1 from oneplus has spoken about echo dot compatibility with Y series, i returned my echo dot for full refund.2)Those posting negative reviews due to echo dot not received, kindly add echo dot from cloudtail in cart with oneplus tv, u vll get it for free.3)Those posting negative reviews that after tv return oneplus gave nly 19965 rs, please return your echo dot too they remaining approx 3045rs will be refunded then only.4)I connected my JBl sound bar and watched movies on Prime , I bet the dolby atmos did its work 100%, and its natural u can't expect soundbar sound at 23k.5) pre-book cashback of 1000rs is credited to my amazon pay balance.",first review 43y1 experience 43 inch far liked tvtv default energy saving picture mode change desire mode get best picture experience changed many picture setting picture quality way better mi realme mesound quality living room enough dolby atmos work carm tatasky hd channel support dolby audiothe lag fixed much extentlast input memory also fixed tv remembers last input switching offthe installation bit crisp guy didnt turn promised date amazon escalated yesterday new guy came installatedcherry cake installation free also wall mount bracket worth rs500 provided free installation teaminstalled demo given promptlyalso noted 43 inch different graphic processor 32 inch g51 mp3updating experience 4 day experienced lag nly twice 4 daystv take approx 1 min get ontheres bit motion blur would fixed update arises due dnr settingssound output overall good range cant expect soundbar like bassprebook extended warranty activated mail confirmation received ackopicture quality awesome setting proper backlight contrast etcblacks properly seen blackthis va panel much concerned viewing angle va panel best straight view angle produce good contrast color reproductionthis tv sameviewing angle cant reviewed end see blur viewd 150 angle obvious va paneldata saver option alexa support yet updated tvas alexa support tv there option login oneplus account free echo dot use tv may provide update thisupdating review test done1 rgb colour gamat test performing perfectly tv see computer rgb reproduce proper color2motion blur much tv expect fix via update3 tv remote bluetooth ir turned bluetooth remote using ir draining battery ir cant use google assistant function4 support echo dot confirmed hopefully update5 data saver option yet6 backlight bleeding present 10 common led tv7 color reproduction good tooupdating review clarification experience 26071 echo dot compatible no1 oneplus spoken echo dot compatibility series returned echo dot full refund2those posting negative review due echo dot received kindly add echo dot cloudtail cart oneplus tv u vll get free3those posting negative review tv return oneplus gave nly 19965 r please return echo dot remaining approx 3045rs refunded only4i connected jbl sound bar watched movie prime bet dolby atmos work 100 natural u cant expect soundbar sound 23k5 prebook cashback 1000rs credited amazon pay balance,0.259925788497217

7,"1. Picture quality is good. Look & Feel is good. I would quote ""Best in this segment TVs."" I have explored most of the well noted brands in this price segment.2. Sound is 3/5. With Dolby Digital Plus enabled, it is better.3. TV build quality is good, Viewing Angles are good too.4. 4K Videos will be reset to 1080p and this is the maximum resolution for any video.5. Only 4.6GB memory is available out of 8GB.6. Oxygen Play is useless.7. There is bloatware instead of oneplus clean software motto.8. Accessing Tv with Oneplus connect App is 1 out of 5. Its a disaster.9. Wall Mount is free. It will be brought by installation provider, do not shell extra bucks for wall mount or installation.10. Apps take ~10 sec to open, I am expecting optimization over next updates.11. USB Ports doesn't support FAT32 Memory sticks (Pendrive, Hard Disk, or Phone). I am disappointed for this one.12. Max viewing distance can be 8 feet. (My vision is 6/6 for both eyes)13. Though Google Play Store is given, you cannot install even google chrome. I see only Chinese apps are available even in google play store. Don't expect to install apps just like you do it on smart phone.14. No issue with remote and response time is good too. Remote build quality is good too.15. No heating issues noted so far.16. Supports only 2.4 Ghz band WiFi.17. No manual power switch. If remote doesn't work, it will be a hell with Tv.18. Chromecast has ~0.3 sec delay which is very bad if you connect with laptop and work with mouse/touch pad.Suggestion 1: If price is not a issue, go for Samsung or LG.Suggestion 2: Want to enjoy premium experience, buy premium Tv, do not expect to find it from Chinese brands. Time is money, the more time you spend in exploring the options and unboxing videos in YouTube, consider adding that amount to the TV you buy.Hope my review will be a help.",1 picture quality good look feel good would quote best segment tv explored well noted brand price segment2 sound 35 dolby digital plus enabled better3 tv build quality good viewing angle good too4 4k video reset 1080p maximum resolution video5 46gb memory available 8gb6 oxygen play useless7 bloatware instead oneplus clean software motto8 accessing tv oneplus connect app 1 5 disaster9 wall mount free brought installation provider shell extra buck wall mount installation10 apps take 10 sec open expecting optimization next updates11 usb port doesnt support fat32 memory stick pendrive hard disk phone disappointed one12 max viewing distance 8 foot vision 66 eyes13 though google play store given cannot install even google chrome see chinese apps available even google play store dont expect install apps like smart phone14 issue remote response time good remote build quality good too15 heating issue noted far16 support 24 ghz band wifi17 manual power switch remote doesnt work hell tv18 chromecast 03 sec delay bad connect laptop work mousetouch padsuggestion 1 price issue go samsung lgsuggestion 2 want enjoy premium experience buy premium tv expect find chinese brand time money time spend exploring option unboxing video youtube consider adding amount tv buyhope review help,0.19783163265306133

13,The video quality is good but  sound quality is average with marginal noise on higher volume. I have viewed Online content and seen DTH tv they  gives true colors and you will truly love it.Dolby sound quality is enough even for living room . For DTH opt for a Dolby supported settop box. I am using airtel xtream box (4k)which is only 2249 for airtel thanks customer .SOFTWARE lags at times and when you select Live TV at times it will not start and gets back to homescreen. Was able to mirror cast through oneplus connect. OnePlus connect app helps to use mobile as remote after the initial update. The viewing angles are ok but this is VA panel so nothing like IPS panel. OnePlus has done good job with regards to video quality as it gives DCI P3 color gamut . Google assistant works fine too. The best thing is the customer service OnePlus offers which is top notch and they listen to you with patience. After sales matter and customer service matter alot in this era.

16,"Ordered on 18th and got it by 20th Afternoon, here's an honest review.But before that, here's a few tips for people who are going to buy it.You'll get an Echo Dot only if you order it with the tv at the same time, read the terms and conditions before leaving one star reviews because you didn't order the echo dot from your end and obviously didn't get it with the TV.To use the One Plus Connect app, you have to update the TV first, the OTA will be there when you turn on the TV for the first time.After that, open the connect server app on the TV, and then open the Connect app on the phone and it would work.Again, do a little research before leaving negative reviews and confusing the potential buyers.The type sync function(use the phone to type on the tv through the Connect App) doesn't work as of now, but would start working in the next app update. Head over to the community forum for the one plus tv to find more details.If you talk about hardware, the TV is flawless, those who are complaining about the TV simply have a bigger room that the TV is designed for. You can always buy a soundbar if you think the volume isn't sufficient for your room. For me, it's more than enough.The display is top notch and the colors are vibrant. It's truly bezel-less and looks beautiful.About the software, there are a few misses here and there, but I'm sure it can be fixed through a software update.ScreenCast lags a lot, I'm waiting for an update to see if it's fixed.To people who think that the TV lags a lot, think of the TV as a phone with 1 GB RAM, if you keep opening apps repeatedly in a short period of time, the phone would lag, same is the case with the TV.It's a value for money for those who don't wanna spend a fortune to get a TV with a good display.",ordered 18th got 20th afternoon here honest reviewbut here tip people going buy ityoull get echo dot order tv time read term condition leaving one star review didnt order echo dot end obviously didnt get tvto use one plus connect app update tv first ota turn tv first timeafter open connect server app tv open connect app phone would workagain little research leaving negative review confusing potential buyersthe type sync functionuse phone type tv connect app doesnt work would start working next app update head community forum one plus tv find detailsif talk hardware tv flawless complaining tv simply bigger room tv designed always buy soundbar think volume isnt sufficient room enoughthe display top notch color vibrant truly bezelless look beautifulabout software miss im sure fixed software updatescreencast lag lot im waiting update see fixedto people think tv lag lot think tv phone 1 gb ram keep opening apps repeatedly short period time phone would lag case tvits value money dont wanna spend fortune get tv good display,0.16395833333333334

20,"Overall Analysis and Reviews for all prospective buyers -1. Picture Quality -The TV is definitely a worthy purchase as its Picture Quality is by far the best in class in compared to other competitors.Build Quality too is Good.The bezel and screen is definitely a Masterpiece as the Bezels are indeed Minimum & the way the screen is built is extremely Unique and different than other competitors.Can't comment on Viewing Angles as honestly I am not an expert also most people watch TV directly in straight direction and all these Viewing Angles talk is just a gimmick to confuse you all.2. OSEarlier reports were that the TV is very laggy especially w.r.t 32inch however I did not experience much lag. One needs to understand that in this segment all competitors offer similar config of Ram and Processor which are definitely not high-end HOWEVER like how it has been hyped on Lag part .. I found it to be rather untrue as Lag exists but not to a huge extent.OnePlus own software optimization is amazing as really clean and bloat free.The TV remembers the last input and so turns on by default on the said input mode on boot-up.Tv has a unique style of Boot Up and Shut down method as on single power off press it seems TV is more on standby mode and only on Long Press of power off will the TV shutdown completely.Boot up timing is good as its not too delayed.3. Sound - Major let down as sound is definitely not at all.upto the mark however this is problem which is common amongst all competitors as each hv low Quality speakers only.I already have a soundbar so this aspect anywhich ways had 0 impact as all competitors fail in sound aspect in these cost segment of TVs totally per my experience.4. Accessibility of Ports - Perhaps the major let down for me are the accesibility of the ports as they are not at all User Friendly and not readily accessible specially for people who have opted for Wall Mount like in my case.The downward location of Port is the most Negative aspect for me.However as I hardly use ports much so again not a major impact however for others it can seem to be a problem mainly for users who have more requirements of port like hdmi and all however with an HDMI extender you will be good to go just an investment of 200-300 rs for an extender may be required.Table Top installation people have nothing to be worried off. This is least concern for them.5. Connectivity - Though a single band wifi Router Exists, the same works absolutely fine and 0 loss or issues atleast till now.6. Installation - Installation was a bit challenge mainly due to screw-up by Third party responsible for installation however with Amazon Escalation it was handled timely and despite hiccups TV was installed on the scheduled date only by EOD.There's a lot of confusion with regards to Wall Mount, well let me be clear that Wall Mount is totally Free and nothing needs to be paid at all.Beware that Installation guy may make some charge and ask to pay however fight back, escalate, talk to their Manager or ask for official bill and you will be good to go as nothing will be charged then.Only lack of clarity remains is around the type of Wall Mount used, as in my case , the guy used an generic brand wall Mount bracket and it is not at all clear whether Oneplus has their own branding of Wall Mount.. Maybe others can add-on.7. Remote - Remote design and all is pure beauty with minimalistic design however dont know where the issue seems to be with Remote or otherwise as it could be like at-times mutilple times pressing could be required especially to Turn On the Tv. Not sure whether its remote lag or otherwise - Maybe Oneplus can fine tune with update.Overall Analysis & Recommendation -Tv is definitely highly recommend for people priority and focus is Picture Quality and OS (highly recommended for OTT users like me) .Bedroom TV - Best Choice 💯If you have soundbar then don't think otherwise as its the best option from others outhere literally.MI TV and All completely fail in comparison to this.Got free Echo Dot too.. Many complained of not getting as they did not read the offer properly as the speaker needs to be added in cart along with TV inorder for promo to apply automatically.TV is not Alexa based and so could not completely reap the benefits of the same with Echo however maybe with update this could be sorted too.Also for OTT users like me it should have an option that on Boot-up TV starts at Google Launcher page only - Again update can take care of this .A word of advice for all confused buyer's - read my above detailed guide and then take a call.Nevertheless, you won't be regretted at all with this TV. OnePlus has definitely delivered its premiumness with this TV for sure and which is highly visible too.Will update the reviews if add-on or change of facts.What more are you looking out for .. simply buy this TV.Never Settle !!!😍",overall analysis review prospective buyer 1 picture quality tv definitely worthy purchase picture quality far best class compared competitorsbuild quality goodthe bezel screen definitely masterpiece bezel indeed minimum way screen built extremely unique different competitorscant comment viewing angle honestly expert also people watch tv directly straight direction viewing angle talk gimmick confuse all2 osearlier report tv laggy especially wrt 32inch however experience much lag one need understand segment competitor offer similar config ram processor definitely highend however like hyped lag part found rather untrue lag exists huge extentoneplus software optimization amazing really clean bloat freethe tv remembers last input turn default said input mode bootuptv unique style boot shut method single power press seems tv standby mode long press power tv shutdown completelyboot timing good delayed3 sound major let sound definitely allupto mark however problem common amongst competitor hv low quality speaker onlyi already soundbar aspect anywhich way 0 impact competitor fail sound aspect cost segment tv totally per experience4 accessibility port perhaps major let accesibility port user friendly readily accessible specially people opted wall mount like casethe downward location port negative aspect mehowever hardly use port much major impact however others seem problem mainly user requirement port like hdmi however hdmi extender good go investment 200300 r extender may requiredtable top installation people nothing worried least concern them5 connectivity though single band wifi router exists work absolutely fine 0 loss issue atleast till now6 installation installation bit challenge mainly due screwup third party responsible installation however amazon escalation handled timely despite hiccup tv installed scheduled date eodtheres lot confusion regard wall mount well let clear wall mount totally free nothing need paid allbeware installation guy may make charge ask pay however fight back escalate talk manager ask official bill good go nothing charged thenonly lack clarity remains around type wall mount used case guy used generic brand wall mount bracket clear whether oneplus branding wall mount maybe others addon7 remote remote design pure beauty minimalistic design however dont know issue seems remote otherwise could like attimes mutilple time pressing could required especially turn tv sure whether remote lag otherwise maybe oneplus fine tune updateoverall analysis recommendation tv definitely highly recommend people priority focus picture quality o highly recommended ott user like bedroom tv best choice soundbar dont think otherwise best option others outhere literallymi tv completely fail comparison thisgot free echo dot many complained getting read offer properly speaker need added cart along tv inorder promo apply automaticallytv alexa based could completely reap benefit echo however maybe update could sorted tooalso ott user like option bootup tv start google launcher page update take care word advice confused buyer read detailed guide take callnevertheless wont regretted tv oneplus definitely delivered premiumness tv sure highly visible toowill update review addon change factswhat looking simply buy tvnever settle,0.17012374686716794

24,"Looks Great. Colours are Amazing. However, user Experience is not refined at all for Oneplus standard and even for any other standards for that matter. Will edit the review once OnePlus fixes below issues.Below are some of the bugs I observed in the last 2 days. Needs immediate attention from OP Software Team to protect OP's reputation.1) Very laggy interface across all apps including home screen, play store, voice assistant. Netflix etc.2) When the TV is off, power button had to be pressed couple of times before the TV could turn on3) When the TV is off, Bluetooth keeps connecting back and disconnecting from TV (Alexa keep saying got connected to Oneplus TV every few mins when used as a external speaker even when TV is off)4) TV also takes time to register inputs from OP Connect app. No keyboard on OP connect app. After restart again need to open Connect app on TV for OP Connect app on mobile to detect OP TV.5) Customize Channels on the homescreen keeps getting reset6) Even when no input is connected to the TV, the TV boots to one of the inputs (HDMI/Channel Scan) instead of home screen.7) Menu button hardly has any use on home screen and only works when used with external inputs.8) There is no option to adjust colours/sound in realtime with hardware remote (i.e.while watching media on TV)9) Alexa app does not recognize the TV even after adding and linking Account in Oneplus TV skillI guess can't be fixed with Software but still want to capture for records (While watching from straight gives great picture quality in the class, viewing angles are pretty bad compared to competition)",look great colour amazing however user experience refined oneplus standard even standard matter edit review oneplus fix issuesbelow bug observed last 2 day need immediate attention op software team protect ops reputation1 laggy interface across apps including home screen play store voice assistant netflix etc2 tv power button pressed couple time tv could turn on3 tv bluetooth keep connecting back disconnecting tv alexa keep saying got connected oneplus tv every min used external speaker even tv off4 tv also take time register input op connect app keyboard op connect app restart need open connect app tv op connect app mobile detect op tv5 customize channel homescreen keep getting reset6 even input connected tv tv boot one input hdmichannel scan instead home screen7 menu button hardly use home screen work used external inputs8 option adjust colourssound realtime hardware remote iewhile watching medium tv9 alexa app recognize tv even adding linking account oneplus tv skilli guess cant fixed software still want capture record watching straight give great picture quality class viewing angle pretty bad compared competition,0.10364583333333335
25,"Got this tv as a cheap and small entertainment unit for my bedroom. Below are the quick pointers:Pros:1. Overall design is very sleek with almost non-existent bezels on three sides. Back mount is available, along with two plastic feets that hold the tv up nice and firmly however you install it. Enough connectivity options incl HDMI arc, optical, spdif and they work as intended.2. Standard smart remote with Netflix, Prime, YouTube and Google assistant buttons. Please note that you have to pair the remote with the tv for the first time before you can use the Bluetooth mode (search in web).3. The display is pretty good with excellent color accuracy though there's no HDR/Dolby Vision support. However, I've seen the HDR implementation in cheap TVs, and I'd rather have overall bright and uniform screen which this tv provides. Minimum backlight bleeding. Slight loss of brightness at high angles of viewing but pq remains same.4. Sound quality is pretty average, but loud. It's good enough for a 10/10 room but at more than 50% volume, the dialogues become difficult to understand. I've heard the speakers in other sub 30k sets and this one is definitely among the top 3.5. Inbuilt Android 9 OS is pretty good, have access to almost all the entertainment apps that work out of the box. There's a bit of lag at times when switching apps and scrolling the menu but it's not too distracting.6. Works great with Google home and offers full voice control. Inbuilt Chromecast is fast and connects quickly. You can also cast video from laptop using Chrome/VLC/other cast apps.Cons:1. Only 768p though YouTube will go to full hd. Given the price point, it's fair, but a full hd panel would've been worth more to both consumers and company. At close distance, you can see the LEDs but more than 3ft, you're game.2. No 5ghz WiFi band support, but that's alright because sub hd content will not need more than 5-10mbps at max. Channel congestion can be a problem if you have too many devices connected to the 2.4ghz band, so keep that in mind.3. Remote lags a bit post cold startup. Especially in apps like Hotstar. Maybe software update will fix.",got tv cheap small entertainment unit bedroom quick pointerspros1 overall design sleek almost nonexistent bezel three side back mount available along two plastic feets hold tv nice firmly however install enough connectivity option incl hdmi arc optical spdif work intended2 standard smart remote netflix prime youtube google assistant button please note pair remote tv first time use bluetooth mode search web3 display pretty good excellent color accuracy though there hdrdolby vision support however ive seen hdr implementation cheap tv id rather overall bright uniform screen tv provides minimum backlight bleeding slight loss brightness high angle viewing pq remains same4 sound quality pretty average loud good enough 1010 room 50 volume dialogue become difficult understand ive heard speaker sub 30k set one definitely among top 35 inbuilt android 9 o pretty good access almost entertainment apps work box there bit lag time switching apps scrolling menu distracting6 work great google home offer full voice control inbuilt chromecast fast connects quickly also cast video laptop using chromevlcother cast appscons1 768p though youtube go full hd given price point fair full hd panel wouldve worth consumer company close distance see led 3ft youre game2 5ghz wifi band support thats alright sub hd content need 510mbps max channel congestion problem many device connected 24ghz band keep mind3 remote lag bit post cold startup especially apps like hotstar maybe software update fix,0.22276190476190474

125,"If you're going to purchase this product make sure you have atleast 4gb / day data plan dedicated to this TV.Also you need a WiFi router for getting full functionality.Let me start with the pros1. Picture quality is great. You'll need some Tweeks though. Set it on movie preset for day time use. Energy saving for night time use. I reduced backlight to 20 and it's in user mode to reduce eye strain.2. Audio quality is good. You also need a lot of Tweeks though.Set it in movie preset if you're watching movies. This preset let's you hear all the music details also you'll hear the dialogues crystal clear. In this mode you won't hear bass that much. You'll get a hint of base nothing much. Because base will affect the Dialogues.Set it in music preset if you're listening to music in this preset you'll hear all the highs and lows crystal clear. You'll get bass as well.Okay now discuss about the consEverything else in this TV is a con.It has data saver installed but you can't able to access it. Data savers has an update in playstore. For some reason it's not updating.You can't use this TV as a Bluetooth speaker. You have to cast your phone screen in order to play your music on TV screen.Which brings a lot of problems. First you need a WiFi router with 2 GB data dedicated to this TV for casting only. Because it's using Chromecast not miracast. So what happens is, you are sharing your mobile screen to your TV using mobile data even though it's on same network. Which is stupid. Why in the world I have to spend my data to transfer the data packets using my router. It's on same network for god's sake.Also while casting if you open YouTube in your phone it opens YouTube app on tv, so you'll end up spending 3X data for playing YouTube video. ( For playing in mobile, for transferring data to tv and for the video playing on TV). But fellow competitors like mi TV also have built in Chromecast only. I don't know any budget TV which supports miracast, if you knew comment below to let me know.It can only access hard disc upto 2tb.Some apps like Udemy are not supported on this TV.You're going to spend more money on ott, let me explain how.. if you're going to use Netflix on TV you'll need premium subscription to add 2-4 devices at a time. Also if you have Airtel xstreme on your phone, and thinking I can use Airtel xstreme on tv.. you're wrong.. you need to purchase xstreme for TV as well.If you're rich enough to purchase all ott platforms and have enough money to spend 4gb / day data on TV on regular basis, you'll love this TV.Otherwise you're gonna end up hating this TV and yourself for purchasing this TV.I chose to purchase this TV because it's an Android TV, also home services during warranty period is free. I don't have to take this TV to the service centre, if there's something's wrong. After warranty period they charge ₹450 for the service. Which is cheaper than other brand.But if I knew I'm gonna get this for ₹16k I wouldn't even think about purchasing this TV. Because I got these picture and audio in my old Sansui LCD tv. Which lasted 5 years without any issues.",youre going purchase product make sure atleast 4gb day data plan dedicated tvalso need wifi router getting full functionalitylet start pros1 picture quality great youll need tweeks though set movie preset day time use energy saving night time use reduced backlight 20 user mode reduce eye strain2 audio quality good also need lot tweeks thoughset movie preset youre watching movie preset let hear music detail also youll hear dialogue crystal clear mode wont hear bass much youll get hint base nothing much base affect dialoguesset music preset youre listening music preset youll hear high low crystal clear youll get bass wellokay discus conseverything else tv conit data saver installed cant able access data saver update playstore reason updatingyou cant use tv bluetooth speaker cast phone screen order play music tv screenwhich brings lot problem first need wifi router 2 gb data dedicated tv casting using chromecast miracast happens sharing mobile screen tv using mobile data even though network stupid world spend data transfer data packet using router network god sakealso casting open youtube phone open youtube app tv youll end spending 3x data playing youtube video playing mobile transferring data tv video playing tv fellow competitor like mi tv also built chromecast dont know budget tv support miracast knew comment let knowit access hard disc upto 2tbsome apps like udemy supported tvyoure going spend money ott let explain youre going use netflix tv youll need premium subscription add 24 device time also airtel xstreme phone thinking use airtel xstreme tv youre wrong need purchase xstreme tv wellif youre rich enough purchase ott platform enough money spend 4gb day data tv regular basis youll love tvotherwise youre gonna end hating tv purchasing tvi chose purchase tv android tv also home service warranty period free dont take tv service centre there somethings wrong warranty period charge 450 service cheaper brandbut knew im gonna get 16k wouldnt even think purchasing tv got picture audio old sansui lcd tv lasted 5 year without issue,0.03726190476190477

130,"After using 43y1 for 1+ monthBought this OnePlus 43y1 android tv for a very cheap price, but the product isn't upto oneplus standards.The picture quality is OK, and sometimes it gets flaky and dark for no reasons. Once i fiddle around with the picture settings this issue fixes, but it happens frequently. It's like the tv is unable to remember the picture settings.Sound quality is also just about OK. There's like literally no bass. Doesn't matter how many different audio settings you try, the audio is weak. But, you could say, ""Itna paisa me itna-ich milega"".Important issues:The tv hangs, it just freezes, not very much, but once in every 3-4 days. Then you have to restart it from the main switch.Many times there's no audio. Doesn't matter which input you try. To fix this I have to restart the tv from the main switch.I sometimes connect bluetooth headphones to my tv. To connect it the first time, obviously, pairing is required. But, to connect it the second time, I have to unpair my headphones, and then again pair it. Otherwise the headphones won't connect automatically. And there's no option to search manually for previously connected devices. Every time I have to unpair and then pair the bluetooth device.The tv remote hangs too. Not all the times. Mostly it works very smooth, but sometimes it hangs. I think this issue is because sometimes the remote doesn't get connected to tv via Bluetooth.Not to forget the tv doesn't have a 3.5 mm jack.You cannot access tv settings while you are using any app. You will have to close the app and go to home screen to change audio/video settings, etc.Netflix only works in HD quality. There's no FHD support for Netflix. I use 4k Netflix subscription, but on this tv it only works in HD.The Alexa support is still not available in the tv. I just cannot connect my Amazon Echo device to the tv. Tried everything, every steps i could find on the internet over several forums. At the end a OnePlus official answered my query on one of OnePlus official forums that the Alexa support will be made through an app, which will be released shortly. The app isn't released till date.Overall, I five 3.5 stars to the tv. Just because of price and remote design.

The colours are not great either. Does not have different picture/colour modes. The biggest con for me is that it does not have adaptive display and gets too bright in low light while in standard settings.Overall - for the price of ₹22K - ₹23K the TV is totally worth buying.

Finally, I got a working product.After using it for 6 months, we were watching the TV suddenly it stopped working. I raised a complaint immediately. I waited for few days and started calling customer care. Every day, the phone will be attending by different executives they will tell theirs on stories. It will be assigned to Technician or the call with escalated to you will get a call back so and so... After a month and half the complaint got assigned to a technician and without visiting the site they told they have ordered for parts.During all this time, we were using our old TV. Good that we haven't sold.At last, they came the home with a TV and exchanged some parts with our TV. The TV is working.. but one issue. The TV display is coming opposite side. If we rotate the TV only we will be able to see. Now they told me there are no settings in the remote to change the direction. They will come with software to resolve this issue.  Again the service person came and tried to fix it but still, it's not resolved.Now they want to take the TV to service place and we have to get it from there. Not sure how much time it will take.This is my experience with the OnePlus TV. I would suggest don't go for this product..

(Those who have missed Echo Dot, I feel very sorry for them)Also Alexa worked me as a smart connector between TV and my Sony home theatre system, without any digital cables or converters ..! Saved my money there too..!!1. Picture Quality : Is pretty good and 1080i LED display. Viewing angle should be straight and if it’s more than 30degree picture clarity will reduce and colours starts fading. Make sure you are straight infront of TV view.2. Sound Quality : is ok kind of Quality at this price as I am depending more on home theatre speakers, thus it’s good for me.3. Value for money : yes definitely you can choose at this budget unless like other brands of this range and it’s 43”.5.chromecasting is built-in, can avail from IOs platform too as I am using it..!4.

And they drilled total 5 holes on the TV Mounting board for 4 screw!! and the Wooden board got damaged.

   This review is in usage of 9 months. Worst product from OnePlus. I just don't even understand why they had to come into TV. My personal opinion always go with Sony or LG. It is the best.2nd time issue with the display.First issue arrived after 4 months I bought the TV. Same as you see in the picture. (This image is second time issue)But it was working for 30 mins and it started to fade away. I usually don't use the TV much so I didn't care about it for 2 months. Then it started to fade forever. So had to book a service. Nonsense in this pandemic. It took 2 months to fix.Fine atleast some picture to see in the second lockdown after the service. And it didn't like to work after 1 month after the 1st service. Same kind of issue. This image is reference after 1st service done to display. (Changing the whole display).I personally recommend Sony of LG. They are best in TVs. Ofcourse they are high priced for what reason you guys might think. This is the reason.These guys, I just don't understand why did I even step foot in these kinds of company's for a different product. They are utter waste of time and money. I have used the TV only for 6 months. That's it.And I'm in second services with one year.Bullshit what others think about this TV or the brand.

216,"The product itself is great value for money for less than 25k for a 43 inch Android LED TV. Overall picture quality is great at normal viewing angles but the colours shift slightly at extreme wide viewing angles. But it will be good enough in most situations.There are lot of picture and sound settings, it also supports Dolby. You can easily connect your Bluetooth headset or soundbar. Sound quality lacks bass and punch, it's not great for movies or songs, but enough for usual News and Sports. For movies I suggest to use dedicated soundbar or home theatre. Remote control has only Bluetooth functionality. No infrared, so battery drain might be faster. Sometimes TV lags to recognize remote operation.TV stand is plastic and feels kinda weak. It wobbles a bit when you nudge the screen. There is no AUX output. Only optical for audio out. Apparently HDMI ARC is there. But haven't tried it.WiFi connectivity is good and fast, though it connects only to 2.4GHz bands. TV has only 1GB RAM so it tends to lag a bit while running more than 2 apps in background. But it's acceptable in normal circumstances. There seems to be no surge protection so better to connect it to a stabilizer if your electricity fluctuates often.USB pen drives can be connected and we can also choose different audio languages in the movie files if available, which is great.It's a great TV for the price. More worth than Sony or LG which are well above 35k for Android models of same size.

One can tell how OnePlus managed to price this at 25k when you pay attention to how they've cut corners on the quality. The OnePlus logo on the front is titled (first time I've ever seen this on a product from a reputed brand). There's a considerable gap between the display and top corner bezels, and the plastic finishing isn't even-There's a lag when you're operating the TV (switching between apps, browsing content, and giving Google assistant voice commands) 50% of the time.

248,"Reviewing after using the product for a month.*Picture quality is awesome. It will beat many other competitors in this price range but not that great as boasted in the launch event.*Sound Quality is average. But you have to make some changes in the settings to get a good sound output. But compared to Motorola and realme tv in this price range, it'll lose. In this TV to get a good sound output, you have to max the volume.*Software is the point where I got disappointed from one plus. I expected many things because it's a TV from Oneplus. The TV lags a little bit. Control from the TV remote takes 1-2 seconds for the TV to operate. I hope one plus gives a good proper update to clear this problem.*Ram is 1gb and the storage is 8gb out of which the available is 3.6gb. Motorola has 4.6gb of free space. So a little disappointment but it's a TV after all not a smartphone.* Input ports works fine and u won't get a 3.5mm port.*Opening an app takes some time which is a little irritating.*As said about the Oneplus connect app, it's not that hype what you saw during the launch event. One annoying thing is you have to open a oneplus connect app from the TV and then you can use it from your smartphone. Typing option is not available.* Sometimes the TV doesn't open YouTube. Have to restart the TV and then open YouTube.If Oneplus is seeing this Review I expect you to solve the software issue regarding the lag which annoys a lotOne more thing I couldn't connect Alexa to this TV.Also I couldn't connect Google remote.Overall it's a good budget TV. But it's not that buttery smooth.

   I bought OnePlus 32 Y series smart TV on 16 Sep 2020 and during the initial usage I felt like this was the best grab for the price because Oneplus gives its superior build quality and smart features and everything seems to be fine for first 2 months.Literally everything was good .But after two months of usage the TV suddenly started showing display issues , such as change in colour , flickering etc and this issue disappears when the TV is  RESTARTED . Again this issue started appearing on random basis and goes when restarted.So when this happened multiple times I myself recorded a video and pictures  of the same and contacted amazon for the service.Believe me this is where it all started to become worser. The technician visited my home and confirmed it that the TV is having manufacturing defect as it doesn't have any physical damage.From then it almost took 2 months of continued followup with amazon customer care to solve my issue. The issue was escalated multiple time and still was not resolved. I talked with superior associate still they also couldn't solve my issue ,at last after multiple complaints and escalation on priority basis and to management level , they had to accept the return as an exception.OnePlus brand didn't meet the expectations in its TV.",medium could loaded bought oneplus 32 series smart tv 16 sep 2020 initial usage felt like best grab price oneplus give superior build quality smart feature everything seems fine first 2 monthsliterally everything good two month usage tv suddenly started showing display issue change colour flickering etc issue disappears tv restarted issue started appearing random basis go restartedso happened multiple time recorded video picture contacted amazon servicebelieve started become worser technician visited home confirmed tv manufacturing defect doesnt physical damagefrom almost took 2 month continued followup amazon customer care solve issue issue escalated multiple time still resolved talked superior associate still also couldnt solve issue last multiple complaint escalation priority basis management level accept return exceptiononeplus brand didnt meet expectation tv,0.21084656084656084

The sound quality isn't all that impressive. The speakers aren't loud enough. I'm using additional speakers with my TV.2. The processor used is quite slow. I see apps hanging at times which forces me to reboot the TV.3. The setup process wasn't very smooth. When I first started the TV, I couldn't install or update apps. I had to reset the TV to get the play store working.4. I can't find a way to boot the TV to the home screen. It directly boots to the live TV interface. I don't have cable or set-top box so this doesn't make sense to me. If there is a way, I haven't been able to find out how yet after searching a lot online.5. The base of the TV doesn't feel stable. One has to take a lot of care if one wants to move the TV.6. It's very inconvenient that the ports in the center especially because of point #5 if your TV is on the table. This makes it hard to access the ports. We have to move the TV to access the ports and #5 makes it difficult. The ports should have been placed on the side. Since USB is the port I'll be using the most, I got around the problem by purchasing a USB cable that I can access without moving the TV.I went for the 43in TV instead of the 55in one just because I don't have place to keep the larger 55in TV. If you have place for the 55in TV and if it fits into your budget, I would recommend going for that one. It would have been nice if OnePlus offered a 43in TV with all the 55in features for a slightly higher price than the current 43in TV.",like tv overall good picture quality software interface would recommend however feel following could done differently1 sound quality isnt impressive speaker arent loud enough im using additional speaker tv2 processor used quite slow see apps hanging time force reboot tv3 setup process wasnt smooth first started tv couldnt install update apps reset tv get play store working4 cant find way boot tv home screen directly boot live tv interface dont cable settop box doesnt make sense way havent able find yet searching lot online5 base tv doesnt feel stable one take lot care one want move tv6 inconvenient port center especially point 5 tv table make hard access port move tv access port 5 make difficult port placed side since usb port ill using got around problem purchasing usb cable access without moving tvi went 43in tv instead 55in one dont place keep larger 55in tv place 55in tv fit budget would recommend going one would nice oneplus offered 43in tv 55in feature slightly higher price current 43in tv,0.06978787878787877

297,"Back in July 2020, OnePlus launched its budget TVs line up. I prebooked the TV on the launch day itself. After around two weeks, the TV went on flash sale for the first time. I received the TV after a week. I got the TV for around Rs.20,000. I prebooked the device for Rs 1000, which gave me two years extended warranty and Rs 1000 amazon cashback. Also, I got Amazon Echo Dot for free and a TV which I returned and got a refund for the same. It was a great deal, and so I decided to go for the OnePlus TV.With an excellent price tag, it comes with some exciting features like OnePlus Connect, Dolby Audio Enhancement, Oxygen Play, Chromecast, Google Assistant built-in and compatible with Amazon Alexa. I was very much excited to unbox and try the OnePlus TV. It also comes with Android 9.0. Unboxing the TV and attaching the table mount was an easy process. Also, setting up the device was very easy.Initial Impressions:When I first started the device, it was lagging a lot. However, there was already a software update available when I just started the device. I quickly updated the device, and the TV was still not working smooth enough. I think going 1 GB RAM is not enough. The picture quality is impressive, and the sound quality isn’t good at default settings. After tweaking the sound, it sounded terrific. Regarding connectivity, it was very smooth. The bezel-less design was the most attractive part of the TV.Design:The design is the most decisive point of the TV. It comes with a bezel-less display, an 88.5% screen to body ratio, and an enhanced viewing experience. It is slim from the back of the TV. Also, the ports are accessible quite easily. The table mount is also of decent quality, and there is a LED indicator in the bottom right corner of the TV. Overall, I loved the design and form factor of the TV.Rating: 4.5/5.Display:The display comes with a bunch of fancy features. It comes with a 1080p resolution and has DCI-P3 93% provides excellent colour reproduction. It uses Gamma Engine for picture enhancement and has features like Anti-Aliasing, Noise Reduction, Dynamic Contrast and colour space mapping. It also comes with various display tweaks such as sports mode, movie mode and many others. But I just tweaked them to get the best out of the TV. The default settings aren’t as good as expected. After tweaking, the colours and overall picture quality is soothing. Although, I think the 60fps doesn’t look smooth enough. It seems like 30-40 fps. To sum up, the display is excellent at this price point, although you need to tweak the settings to get the best out of the display.Rating: 4/5Sound:It comes with a 20W speaker output and also supports Dolby Audio Enhancement. The default sound settings aren’t sounding that great. After tweaking the audio settings, it works at its best. It is loud enough and no complaints apart from default settings.Rating: 4/5Connectivity:We get all the required connectivity options. It comes with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, Ethernet, RF Connection Input, HDMI Input, AV Input, Digital Audio Output and USB Ports. And the most legendary feature is the OnePlus Connect. We can control the TV entirely using a phone, take screenshots of the TV and save and share it. You can also control the TV actions such as volume, switch input, open apps, and turn off TV using Amazon Echo Dot. But there is an issue with the remote. TV won't power on-off-on the first attempt. It also doesn’t have a dedicated input switch button.Rating: 3/5Pros:1)  Awesome colour accuracy, DCI-P3 93% and beautiful display quality.2)  Great sound quality with features like Dolby Audio Enhancement, Dialogue Enhancer, Dolby Surround etc3)  OnePlus Connect App features like taking TV Screenshots, controlling TV etc.4)  Aggressive price point.5)  Amazon Echo Dot integration and Google Assistant Built-In.6)  Bezel-Less display enhances the viewing experience.Cons:1)  It lags a lot at times and especially after turning on the TV from sleep mode.2)  TV won't power on the first attempt 90% of the times.3)  Default Audio and Display Settings aren’t the best.4)  1 GB RAM isn’t enough for the TV.5)  No Wall Mount inside the box.6)  No input switch button on the remote.",back july 2020 oneplus launched budget tv line prebooked tv launch day around two week tv went flash sale first time received tv week got tv around rs20000 prebooked device r 1000 gave two year extended warranty r 1000 amazon cashback also got amazon echo dot free tv returned got refund great deal decided go oneplus tvwith excellent price tag come exciting feature like oneplus connect dolby audio enhancement oxygen play chromecast google assistant builtin compatible amazon alexa much excited unbox try oneplus tv also come android 90 unboxing tv attaching table mount easy process also setting device easyinitial impressionswhen first started device lagging lot however already software update available started device quickly updated device tv still working smooth enough think going 1 gb ram enough picture quality impressive sound quality isnt good default setting tweaking sound sounded terrific regarding connectivity smooth bezelless design attractive part tvdesignthe design decisive point tv come bezelless display 885 screen body ratio enhanced viewing experience slim back tv also port accessible quite easily table mount also decent quality led indicator bottom right corner tv overall loved design form factor tvrating 455displaythe display come bunch fancy feature come 1080p resolution dcip3 93 provides excellent colour reproduction us gamma engine picture enhancement feature like antialiasing noise reduction dynamic contrast colour space mapping also come various display tweak sport mode movie mode many others tweaked get best tv default setting arent good expected tweaking colour overall picture quality soothing although think 60fps doesnt look smooth enough seems like 3040 fps sum display excellent price point although need tweak setting get best displayrating 45soundit come 20w speaker output also support dolby audio enhancement default sound setting arent sounding great tweaking audio setting work best loud enough complaint apart default settingsrating 45connectivitywe get required connectivity option come 24 ghz wifi bluetooth 50 ethernet rf connection input hdmi input av input digital audio output usb port legendary feature oneplus connect control tv entirely using phone take screenshots tv save share also control tv action volume switch input open apps turn tv using amazon echo dot issue remote tv wont power onoffon first attempt also doesnt dedicated input switch buttonrating 35pros1 awesome colour accuracy dcip3 93 beautiful display quality2 great sound quality feature like dolby audio enhancement dialogue enhancer dolby surround etc3 oneplus connect app feature like taking tv screenshots controlling tv etc4 aggressive price point5 amazon echo dot integration google assistant builtin6 bezelless display enhances viewing experiencecons1 lag lot time especially turning tv sleep mode2 tv wont power first attempt 90 times3 default audio display setting arent best4 1 gb ram isnt enough tv5 wall mount inside box6 input switch button remote,0.3697111631537861

   I think this is great Android TV. I got this @14999. It is definitely worth the money. I am reviewing this product after using it for 10 days. One thing that really annoyed me is that I got this for 14999 and a week after the price dropped to 13999. I know it's not a big deal but 1000 rupees is a big amount and I could have saved it.I will mention some pros and cons of product below and this might help you to make up your mind before you decide to purchase the product.Positive points:1. Picture Quality - The picture quality is superb at this price range.. It looks great, the colours are very bright and the contrast ratio of TV is also very good. The viewing angles on TV are also nice. I have uploaded a video regarding it, you can check it out.2. Smart cum Android TV - This is not just a Smart TV but it is an Android TV. This means you can install and sideload any apps you like as per your liking. I sideloaded a couple of apps and they all worked in first attempt. Earlier I was looking to go for Samsung and LG but both those TV in this price range only offers smart TV features and you can't side load apps in a Smart TV. That's why Android TV is best.3. Attractive Looks - One of the main reason why I bought One plus TV was because of the reason how good it looks. It almost looks like a bezel less display because the bezels on TV are super thin and sleek. The TV surely looks very attractive and it this price range you won't find many TV's as good looking as this.4. Operating system - The OS provided by one plus along with this TV is very smooth and it looks very clean and runs smooth most of the times. You might notice a little bit of lag while opening heavy application but it is hardly noticeable. In this price you can't really ask for much as TV only comes with 1GB of ram and despite that TV runs pretty smooth.5. Connectivity - Connectivity is smooth and fluid. I connected my Xbox controller to play some games via Steamlink and my Bluetooth controller was detected as soon I plugged it in. WiFi also connects within 5 seconds of booting the TV. The boot time of TV is also decent enough and only takes 15-20 seconds for TV to boot.Negative Points:1. Sound - The sound quality of the TV is fine. It is nothing special and not bad either. The sound quality is little above average. I think it could have been a little better.2. Price - Price drop pissed me off 😂😂. I mean come on I paid 1000 extra and one week later the price dropped, that's unfair. The TV is worth at 15k too but it could have been a classic deal if I got this at 14k! 😂3. Mirror Cast - Mirror casting from phone has a lot of delay even though I have a very fast network.All in all this TV is really good and I loved it.Important Info - You will be charged 299 rupees at time of installation of TV if you want to get the TV mounted on wall. The installation will be done at time of delivery and will be done by same people who deliver the TV. The delivery person will call you and inform you regarding the same. For 32 inches they will charge 299 and for above 32 inches you will be charged 399. My installation went very smooth and at first TV was not mounted properly so I requested person to put that in perfect position and he gladly did that for me. Overall I am satisfied with both the product and installation.",medium could loaded think great android tv got 14999 definitely worth money reviewing product using 10 day one thing really annoyed got 14999 week price dropped 13999 know big deal 1000 rupee big amount could saved iti mention pro con product might help make mind decide purchase productpositive points1 picture quality picture quality superb price range look great colour bright contrast ratio tv also good viewing angle tv also nice uploaded video regarding check out2 smart cum android tv smart tv android tv mean install sideload apps like per liking sideloaded couple apps worked first attempt earlier looking go samsung lg tv price range offer smart tv feature cant side load apps smart tv thats android tv best3 attractive look one main reason bought one plus tv reason good look almost look like bezel le display bezel tv super thin sleek tv surely look attractive price range wont find many tv good looking this4 operating system o provided one plus along tv smooth look clean run smooth time might notice little bit lag opening heavy application hardly noticeable price cant really ask much tv come 1gb ram despite tv run pretty smooth5 connectivity connectivity smooth fluid connected xbox controller play game via steamlink bluetooth controller detected soon plugged wifi also connects within 5 second booting tv boot time tv also decent enough take 1520 second tv bootnegative points1 sound sound quality tv fine nothing special bad either sound quality little average think could little better2 price price drop pissed mean come paid 1000 extra one week later price dropped thats unfair tv worth 15k could classic deal got 14k 3 mirror cast mirror casting phone lot delay even though fast networkall tv really good loved itimportant info charged 299 rupee time installation tv want get tv mounted wall installation done time delivery done people deliver tv delivery person call inform regarding 32 inch charge 299 32 inch charged 399 installation went smooth first tv mounted properly requested person put perfect position gladly overall satisfied product installation,0.22502705627705627

   Never expected to write a negative review for OnePlus Product !1. Screen Flickering is the most common problem2. Half of the times, TV doesn't start with a single button press.3.

2119,"TV is beautiful with minute bezels.I was pleased by the picture quality in firstI expected a smooth software from oneplus but TV operation is bit slow probably due to 1gb ram and lower clocked processor. Can't complaint at this price point. Wish oneplus would release better optimized software in update. Software update was one of my reason to buy TV from oneplus.Response from the bluetooth remote was bit slow.But hold bluetooth was very functional. Might be as it is bluetooth 5.0, TV was able to connect to 3+ devices at a time. 1 mobile, 1 bluetooth speaker and remote. That's great.Coming to sound, Speaker quality isn't upto mark. You have multiple options to enhance audio (dolby, surround, presets, dialogue enhancer etc) probably that's the reason oneplus skipped 3.5mm output and opted for optical and HDMI ARC ports to provide quality auido output on external speaker. You should go RCA audio adapters if you want 3.5mm input else connect to speakers using bluetooth adapter. That would cost additional if you want to.If you look for picture quality, minimal design and stick to few ott app this TV is for you.For power users and those who use only 3.5 jack to connect speakers look else where.Update :Oneplus released major update and UI and remote control navigation seems improved now.But setup of new Bluetooth connection got buggy.

2120,"ere is my experience with the Oneplus LAGGY tv32Y model. Here is a list of issues with your product.1. connected to Samsung mobile through google home as the tv isn't connecting through Samsung smart view. always says unable to connect, try again. And even through the google home, it is struggling too much to even cast the photos and forget about casting the videos.2. Neither windows nor Mac is recognising The tv in wireless mode. Had to use third party app from play store to Airplay my Mac n gues what, windows is not recognising the tv. It is really shocking to see Mac recognised where Windows couldn’t (using third party play store app).3. To my bad, even through third party play store app, it is laggy half of the times.4. And how can I ignore to say about Oneplus connect app, Its a wonders**t app, do the gesture wait for couple of seconds and then it responds and you can’t access files through the connect app on this tv.5. And sound, it has options by the name, dolby Audio and Dolby digital plus, fix this in your mind, these two features are just names and these does change the sound experience by zero percentage.6. On Youtube, video quality is limited to 1080p, best to use HDMi cable to your happy and play 4K, only then it felt better than any other video quality experience of this tv.7. Opening and closing apps, is like suspense thriller movie scene experience, you will be waiting to know when it will respond.sometimes suspense extends to 3-10 seconds.8. Viewing angles? acceptable for this price.9. Colors? Green is worst of all and then red , black is good, blue colors are worst, yellows are good and the rest that you find are acceptable.10. Display quality? If any of you ever used the Chinese phones of the last decade, you will get the exact same feeling. I promise you this.11. Best option to put  good use of display and colors is to use pen drive, hard disk or HDMI and play the 4k or full HD videos. This is the only way that this display can make you happy.12. And the remote, the menu button literally never worked on  any app nor on home page. It just exists with void function assigned to it.13. Almost forgot about voice search that is google assistance, 10 out of 10 times, it took 3-10 seconds to launch it.14. Opening an app, Fix in your mind that it will take at least 3-10.15. Once you connect Bluetooth accessory, you have to remove the device from the list, if you want to connect it to other device. you will not have an option to disconnect.",ere experience oneplus laggy tv32y model list issue product1 connected samsung mobile google home tv isnt connecting samsung smart view always say unable connect try even google home struggling much even cast photo forget casting videos2 neither window mac recognising tv wireless mode use third party app play store airplay mac n gues window recognising tv really shocking see mac recognised window couldnt using third party play store app3 bad even third party play store app laggy half times4 ignore say oneplus connect app wonderst app gesture wait couple second responds cant access file connect app tv5 sound option name dolby audio dolby digital plus fix mind two feature name change sound experience zero percentage6 youtube video quality limited 1080p best use hdmi cable happy play 4k felt better video quality experience tv7 opening closing apps like suspense thriller movie scene experience waiting know respondsometimes suspense extends 310 seconds8 viewing angle acceptable price9 color green worst red black good blue color worst yellow good rest find acceptable10 display quality ever used chinese phone last decade get exact feeling promise this11 best option put good use display color use pen drive hard disk hdmi play 4k full hd video way display make happy12 remote menu button literally never worked app home page exists void function assigned it13 almost forgot voice search google assistance 10 10 time took 310 second launch it14 opening app fix mind take least 31015 connect bluetooth accessory remove device list want connect device option disconnect,0.04771825396825395

2123,"First to review 43y1, as my experience with 43 inch So far i liked the Tv.Tv is by default on energy saving picture mode, change to desire mode to get best picture experience, as i changed many picture settings the picture quality is way better than MI & realme me.Sound quality for my living room is more than enough, dolby atmos work carm with my Tatasky HD channels as they support dolby audio.The Lag is fixed to much extent.last input memory is also fixed, TV remembers the last input before switching off.The installation was bit crisp as the guy didn't turn on the promised date, so amazon escalated and yesterday new guy came and installated.Cherry on the cake the installation was free also the wall mount bracket worth Rs500 was provided free by the installation team.Installed and the demo was given very promptly.Also to be noted this 43 inches has different graphic processor than 32 inches G51 Mp3Updating my experience of 4 days -Experienced lag nly twice in 4 days.TV takes a approx of 1 min to get ON.There's a bit motion blur, which would be fixed by update, as it arises due to the DNR in the settings.Sound output is overall good at this range can't expect soundbar like bass.Pre-Book extended warranty has been activated and mail confirmation received from acko.Picture quality is just awesome, with setting proper backlight, contrast etc.Blacks are properly seen black.This has VA panel and i am not much concerned about viewing angles. VA Panels are best for the straight view angle as they produce good contrast and color reproduction,this TV does the same.Viewing angle can't be reviewed from my end as I did see blur when viewd at 150 angle which is obvious for VA panel.Data saver option and alexa support is yet to be updated in this TV.As of now no alexa support for this TV as there's no option to login to oneplus account, so my free echo dot is not of use with this TV as of now, may be they will provide the update to this.Updating my review with some test done1) RGB colour gamat test is performing perfectly on this TV. As you can see computer rgb reproduce proper color.2)motion blur is too much in this TV, expect to be fix via update.3) TV remote is Bluetooth and IR both, i turned of my bluetooth of Remote and using on IR as it's draining battery, when on IR you can't use Google assistant function.4) No support for Echo dot as of now confirmed, hopefully will be in update.5) No data saver option yet.6) backlight bleeding is present at 10% which is common for LED Tv.7) color reproduction is good too.Updating my review to some clarification and my experience 26/071) As echo dot is not compatible and no1 from oneplus has spoken about echo dot compatibility with Y series, i returned my echo dot for full refund.2)Those posting negative reviews due to echo dot not received, kindly add echo dot from cloudtail in cart with oneplus tv, u vll get it for free.3)Those posting negative reviews that after tv return oneplus gave nly 19965 rs, please return your echo dot too they remaining approx 3045rs will be refunded then only.4)I connected my JBl sound bar and watched movies on Prime , I bet the dolby atmos did its work 100%, and its natural u can't expect soundbar sound at 23k.5) pre-book cashback of 1000rs is credited to my amazon pay balance.",first review 43y1 experience 43 inch far liked tvtv default energy saving picture mode change desire mode get best picture experience changed many picture setting picture quality way better mi realme mesound quality living room enough dolby atmos work carm tatasky hd channel support dolby audiothe lag fixed much extentlast input memory also fixed tv remembers last input switching offthe installation bit crisp guy didnt turn promised date amazon escalated yesterday new guy came installatedcherry cake installation free also wall mount bracket worth rs500 provided free installation teaminstalled demo given promptlyalso noted 43 inch different graphic processor 32 inch g51 mp3updating experience 4 day experienced lag nly twice 4 daystv take approx 1 min get ontheres bit motion blur would fixed update arises due dnr settingssound output overall good range cant expect soundbar like bassprebook extended warranty activated mail confirmation received ackopicture quality awesome setting proper backlight contrast etcblacks properly seen blackthis va panel much concerned viewing angle va panel best straight view angle produce good contrast color reproductionthis tv sameviewing angle cant reviewed end see blur viewd 150 angle obvious va paneldata saver option alexa support yet updated tvas alexa support tv there option login oneplus account free echo dot use tv may provide update thisupdating review test done1 rgb colour gamat test performing perfectly tv see computer rgb reproduce proper color2motion blur much tv expect fix via update3 tv remote bluetooth ir turned bluetooth remote using ir draining battery ir cant use google assistant function4 support echo dot confirmed hopefully update5 data saver option yet6 backlight bleeding present 10 common led tv7 color reproduction good tooupdating review clarification experience 26071 echo dot compatible no1 oneplus spoken echo dot compatibility series returned echo dot full refund2those posting negative review due echo dot received kindly add echo dot cloudtail cart oneplus tv u vll get free3those posting negative review tv return oneplus gave nly 19965 r please return echo dot remaining approx 3045rs refunded only4i connected jbl sound bar watched movie prime bet dolby atmos work 100 natural u cant expect soundbar sound 23k5 prebook cashback 1000rs credited amazon pay balance,0.259925788497217

2125,"1. Picture quality is good. Look & Feel is good. I would quote ""Best in this segment TVs."" I have explored most of the well noted brands in this price segment.2. Sound is 3/5. With Dolby Digital Plus enabled, it is better.3. TV build quality is good, Viewing Angles are good too.4. 4K Videos will be reset to 1080p and this is the maximum resolution for any video.5. Only 4.6GB memory is available out of 8GB.6. Oxygen Play is useless.7. There is bloatware instead of oneplus clean software motto.8. Accessing Tv with Oneplus connect App is 1 out of 5. Its a disaster.9. Wall Mount is free. It will be brought by installation provider, do not shell extra bucks for wall mount or installation.10. Apps take ~10 sec to open, I am expecting optimization over next updates.11. USB Ports doesn't support FAT32 Memory sticks (Pendrive, Hard Disk, or Phone). I am disappointed for this one.12. Max viewing distance can be 8 feet. (My vision is 6/6 for both eyes)13. Though Google Play Store is given, you cannot install even google chrome. I see only Chinese apps are available even in google play store. Don't expect to install apps just like you do it on smart phone.14. No issue with remote and response time is good too. Remote build quality is good too.15. No heating issues noted so far.16. Supports only 2.4 Ghz band WiFi.17. No manual power switch. If remote doesn't work, it will be a hell with Tv.18. Chromecast has ~0.3 sec delay which is very bad if you connect with laptop and work with mouse/touch pad.Suggestion 1: If price is not a issue, go for Samsung or LG.Suggestion 2: Want to enjoy premium experience, buy premium Tv, do not expect to find it from Chinese brands.

2134,"Ordered on 18th and got it by 20th Afternoon, here's an honest review.But before that, here's a few tips for people who are going to buy it.You'll get an Echo Dot only if you order it with the tv at the same time, read the terms and conditions before leaving one star reviews because you didn't order the echo dot from your end and obviously didn't get it with the TV.To use the One Plus Connect app, you have to update the TV first, the OTA will be there when you turn on the TV for the first time.After that, open the connect server app on the TV, and then open the Connect app on the phone and it would work.Again, do a little research before leaving negative reviews and confusing the potential buyers.The type sync function(use the phone to type on the tv through the Connect App) doesn't work as of now, but would start working in the next app update. Head over to the community forum for the one plus tv to find more details.If you talk about hardware, the TV is flawless, those who are complaining about the TV simply have a bigger room that the TV is designed for. You can always buy a soundbar if you think the volume isn't sufficient for your room. For me, it's more than enough.The display is top notch and the colors are vibrant. It's truly bezel-less and looks beautiful.About the software, there are a few misses here and there, but I'm sure it can be fixed through a software update.ScreenCast lags a lot, I'm waiting for an update to see if it's fixed.To people who think that the TV lags a lot, think of the TV as a phone with 1 GB RAM, if you keep opening apps repeatedly in a short period of time, the phone would lag, same is the case with the TV.It's a value for money for those who don't wanna spend a fortune to get a TV with a good display.",ordered 18th got 20th afternoon here honest reviewbut here tip people going buy ityoull get echo dot order tv time read term condition leaving one star review didnt order echo dot end obviously didnt get tvto use one plus connect app update tv first ota turn tv first timeafter open connect server app tv open connect app phone would workagain little research leaving negative review confusing potential buyersthe type sync functionuse phone type tv connect app doesnt work would start working next app update head community forum one plus tv find detailsif talk hardware tv flawless complaining tv simply bigger room tv designed always buy soundbar think volume isnt sufficient room enoughthe display top notch color vibrant truly bezelless look beautifulabout software miss im sure fixed software updatescreencast lag lot im waiting update see fixedto people think tv lag lot think tv phone 1 gb ram keep opening apps repeatedly short period time phone would lag case tvits value money dont wanna spend fortune get tv good display,0.16395833333333334

2164,"REVIEW # 1The launched was much awaited for & as soon as the sale for 43inch was out - we booked the TV. The addition of the Amazon Echo Dot was the Cherry on top of the Cake :-) The TV arrived the next day in Good Condition.OBSERVATIONS>> For this price - the TV has an elegant look. The Bezeless Display does indeed live up-to its mark. As per my calculations which includes the bottom logo bar as well - the display screen amounts to 89.74% of the total display.>> Image quality is indeed Amazing. The colours are vibrant. Images truly standout when fed with a 1080p input. The display does pure justice to 4K YouTube videos.>> Audio quality for this price segment yields no complaints. However, You will need a Sound Bar or Home Theater System if You want to enjoy the Video with Bass powered Sound. The TV promises Dolby Audio - but lacks Bass (obviously due to Sound Physics as it does not have a woofer) But still satisfies for a medium sized living room.>> Inputs are adequate taking into consideration the present technological advancements. 2 HDMI inputs for Your STB & Gaming Console. However a 3rd HDMI would have been great to have as spare to connect to a laptop (No really needed though as the TV comes with built-in Chromecast for Screen Mirroring)>> I would rate the OS response 4.25 out 5 as there is some minor lag when using the OS. When I received the TV, I installed the 823Mb update (dated 17Jun) but I believe there should be another update which should improve the OS Performance and fix some bugs within. A bug being the OS is unable to handle a Non-ARC HDMI device well. I enabled the HDMI-ARC service not knowing that my STB does not support ARC. Due to this there is a Blue rotating loading Circle constantly turning on my display when on HDMI input. Of-course disabling this service gets rid of the Blue Circle (But for OnePlus it would be nice to see a popup stating that the input device does not support ARC rather than have a constant Blue Circle on the Screen). Also, my OS still does not have the Data Saver feature which many users have stated that they do not see on their TV's. So anxiously waiting for the next OTA Update.>> As many users are raised the issue - Heavy Lag while using Screen Cast/Mirroring. Hoping again then the OTA update would fix this.>> TV Remote functions purely on Bluetooth. The Remote is compact & has a minimalist design. The best part being the remote has 3 dedicated buttons for OTT apps (Netflix, Prime & YouTube). A drawback I see in the remote is due to it being purely Bluetooth - I no longer can use my Universal Remote for my TV. Also I believe there is a bug in the remote which does not let You switch on the TV instantly (sometimes You have the press the Power button a few times - clearly visible on the red flashing led on the remote) Hoping OTA will fix this issue too. Another issue (my suggestion) with the remote is that it misses the Input Source Button. This missing button makes it extremely difficult for my not so technologically advanced Mother to switch between inputs.>> Another thing that surprises me is that there is a Dedicated Amazon Prime Video Button on my Remote but NO inbuilt Alexa integration. I have to use a Skill on Alexa but unfortunately like many other people I haven't been able to connect my OnePlus TV to my Alexa Account. This makes the supplied Echo Dot 50% useless as I cannot use the Echo Dot to wake up my TV via voice command. Yet to try Google Assistant (but I want Alexa functioning as my other devices are synced with Alexa) If You are reading this point and have been able to Integrate Your OnePlus TV to your Amazon Account - then Please leave me an Answer on my Question.>> The last point being - I am not sure if its a design flaw or a shipping mishap - But the TopLeft & TopRight corners seem to be either damaged or poorly finished by the Assembly Team. (See Images)Overall - this Product has so far satisfied me well. I will certainly be writing another Review when I have the OTA Update to fix some of the Bugs & Add the Missing Features. Until then I will enjoy my OnePlus TV :-)Lastly, 5 Stars to Amazon for providing the option of 2Year Extended Warranty for INR1000 and automatically adding it to my OnePlus after 3 days of arrival.

2273,"If you're going to purchase this product make sure you have atleast 4gb / day data plan dedicated to this TV.Also you need a WiFi router for getting full functionality.Let me start with the pros1. Picture quality is great. You'll need some Tweeks though. Set it on movie preset for day time use. Energy saving for night time use. I reduced backlight to 20 and it's in user mode to reduce eye strain.2. Audio quality is good. You also need a lot of Tweeks though.Set it in movie preset if you're watching movies. This preset let's you hear all the music details also you'll hear the dialogues crystal clear. In this mode you won't hear bass that much. You'll get a hint of base nothing much. Because base will affect the Dialogues.Set it in music preset if you're listening to music in this preset you'll hear all the highs and lows crystal clear. You'll get bass as well.Okay now discuss about the consEverything else in this TV is a con.It has data saver installed but you can't able to access it. Data savers has an update in playstore. For some reason it's not updating.You can't use this TV as a Bluetooth speaker. You have to cast your phone screen in order to play your music on TV screen.Which brings a lot of problems. First you need a WiFi router with 2 GB data dedicated to this TV for casting only. Because it's using Chromecast not miracast. So what happens is, you are sharing your mobile screen to your TV using mobile data even though it's on same network. Which is stupid. Why in the world I have to spend my data to transfer the data packets using my router. It's on same network for god's sake.Also while casting if you open YouTube in your phone it opens YouTube app on tv, so you'll end up spending 3X data for playing YouTube video. ( For playing in mobile, for transferring data to tv and for the video playing on TV). But fellow competitors like mi TV also have built in Chromecast only. I don't know any budget TV which supports miracast, if you knew comment below to let me know.It can only access hard disc upto 2tb.Some apps like Udemy are not supported on this TV.You're going to spend more money on ott, let me explain how.. if you're going to use Netflix on TV you'll need premium subscription to add 2-4 devices at a time. Also if you have Airtel xstreme on your phone, and thinking I can use Airtel xstreme on tv.. you're wrong.. you need to purchase xstreme for TV as well.If you're rich enough to purchase all ott platforms and have enough money to spend 4gb / day data on TV on regular basis, you'll love this TV.Otherwise you're gonna end up hating this TV and yourself for purchasing this TV.I chose to purchase this TV because it's an Android TV, also home services during warranty period is free. I don't have to take this TV to the service centre, if there's something's wrong. After warranty period they charge ₹450 for the service. Which is cheaper than other brand.But if I knew I'm gonna get this for ₹16k I wouldn't even think about purchasing this TV. Because I got these picture and audio in my old Sansui LCD tv.

I even tried all their settings and features available. I then ordered a JBL Infinity home theatre only for the sound thing and then connected it over Bluetooth. It was then beautiful and perfect. But after a couple of days there was a lag between the TV sound output and that from the Home theatre. I then replaced the JBL thing from Amazon and to my surprise found out that even the next one had a similar issue after a couple of days.I'm still worried if the Bluetooth feature of Oneplus TV has an issue or just my specific piece.

Finally, I got a working product.After using it for 6 months, we were watching the TV suddenly it stopped working. I raised a complaint immediately. I waited for few days and started calling customer care. Every day, the phone will be attending by different executives they will tell theirs on stories. It will be assigned to Technician or the call with escalated to you will get a call back so and so... After a month and half the complaint got assigned to a technician and without visiting the site they told they have ordered for parts.During all this time, we were using our old TV. Good that we haven't sold.At last, they came the home with a TV and exchanged some parts with our TV. The TV is working.. but one issue. The TV display is coming opposite side. If we rotate the TV only we will be able to see. Now they told me there are no settings in the remote to change the direction. They will come with software to resolve this issue.

(Those who have missed Echo Dot, I feel very sorry for them)Also Alexa worked me as a smart connector between TV and my Sony home theatre system, without any digital cables or converters ..! Saved my money there too..!!1. Picture Quality : Is pretty good and 1080i LED display. Viewing angle should be straight and if it’s more than 30degree picture clarity will reduce and colours starts fading. Make sure you are straight infront of TV view.2. Sound Quality : is ok kind of Quality at this price as I am depending more on home theatre speakers, thus it’s good for me.3. Value for money : yes definitely you can choose at this budget unless like other brands of this range and it’s 43”.5.chromecasting is built-in, can avail from IOs platform too as I am using it..!4. Includes all the modern smart tv features like Netflix, amazon,YouTube and google assistants in one single button.

   This review is in usage of 9 months. Worst product from OnePlus. I just don't even understand why they had to come into TV. My personal opinion always go with Sony or LG. It is the best.2nd time issue with the display.First issue arrived after 4 months I bought the TV. Same as you see in the picture. (This image is second time issue)But it was working for 30 mins and it started to fade away. I usually don't use the TV much so I didn't care about it for 2 months. Then it started to fade forever. So had to book a service. Nonsense in this pandemic. It took 2 months to fix.Fine atleast some picture to see in the second lockdown after the service. And it didn't like to work after 1 month after the 1st service. Same kind of issue. This image is reference after 1st service done to display. (Changing the whole display).I personally recommend Sony of LG. They are best in TVs. Ofcourse they are high priced for what reason you guys might think. This is the reason.These guys, I just don't understand why did I even step foot in these kinds of company's for a different product. They are utter waste of time and money. I have used the TV only for 6 months. That's it.And I'm in second services with one year.Bullshit what others think about this TV or the brand.

Because of this internet connection through our wifi router is not connected even though other devices get connected with same wifi network. When I do the warranty claim, after three or four visits, either Oneplus or authorized service personal(Amazon itself) cannot find the solution. So every time we switch ON TV we need to set date and time for proper internet connectivity. Otherwise it will work like a normal LED TV only not smart TV.

But you have to make some changes in the settings to get a good sound output. But compared to Motorola and realme tv in this price range, it'll lose. In this TV to get a good sound output, you have to max the volume.*Software is the point where I got disappointed from one plus. I expected many things because it's a TV from Oneplus.

I hope one plus gives a good proper update to clear this problem.*Ram is 1gb and the storage is 8gb out of which the available is 3.6gb. Motorola has 4.6gb of free space. So a little disappointment but it's a TV after all not a smartphone.* Input ports works fine and u won't get a 3.5mm port.*Opening an app takes some time which is a little irritating.*As said about the Oneplus connect app, it's not that hype what you saw during the launch event. One annoying thing is you have to open a oneplus connect app from the TV and then you can use it from your smartphone. Typing option is not available.* Sometimes the TV doesn't open YouTube. Have to restart the TV and then open YouTube.If Oneplus is seeing this Review I expect you to solve the software issue regarding the lag which annoys a lotOne more thing I couldn't connect Alexa to this TV.Also I couldn't connect Google remote.Overall it's a good budget TV. But it's not that buttery smooth.

Again this issue started appearing on random basis and goes when restarted.So when this happened multiple times I myself recorded a video and pictures  of the same and contacted amazon for the service.Believe me this is where it all started to become worser. The technician visited my home and confirmed it that the TV is having manufacturing defect as it doesn't have any physical damage.From then it almost took 2 months of continued followup with amazon customer care to solve my issue. The issue was escalated multiple time and still was not resolved.

The sound quality isn't all that impressive. The speakers aren't loud enough. I'm using additional speakers with my TV.2. The processor used is quite slow. I see apps hanging at times which forces me to reboot the TV.3. The setup process wasn't very smooth. When I first started the TV, I couldn't install or update apps. I had to reset the TV to get the play store working.4. I can't find a way to boot the TV to the home screen. It directly boots to the live TV interface. I don't have cable or set-top box so this doesn't make sense to me. If there is a way, I haven't been able to find out how yet after searching a lot online.5. The base of the TV doesn't feel stable. One has to take a lot of care if one wants to move the TV.6. It's very inconvenient that the ports in the center especially because of point #5 if your TV is on the table. This makes it hard to access the ports. We have to move the TV to access the ports and #5 makes it difficult. The ports should have been placed on the side. Since USB is the port I'll be using the most, I got around the problem by purchasing a USB cable that I can access without moving the TV.I went for the 43in TV instead of the 55in one just because I don't have place to keep the larger 55in TV. If you have place for the 55in TV and if it fits into your budget, I would recommend going for that one. It would have been nice if OnePlus offered a 43in TV with all the 55in features for a slightly higher price than the current 43in TV.",like tv overall good picture quality software interface would recommend however feel following could done differently1 sound quality isnt impressive speaker arent loud enough im using additional speaker tv2 processor used quite slow see apps hanging time force reboot tv3 setup process wasnt smooth first started tv couldnt install update apps reset tv get play store working4 cant find way boot tv home screen directly boot live tv interface dont cable settop box doesnt make sense way havent able find yet searching lot online5 base tv doesnt feel stable one take lot care one want move tv6 inconvenient port center especially point 5 tv table make hard access port move tv access port 5 make difficult port placed side since usb port ill using got around problem purchasing usb cable access without moving tvi went 43in tv instead 55in one dont place keep larger 55in tv place 55in tv fit budget would recommend going one would nice oneplus offered 43in tv 55in feature slightly higher price current 43in tv,0.06978787878787877

2425,"Back in July 2020, OnePlus launched its budget TVs line up. I prebooked the TV on the launch day itself. After around two weeks, the TV went on flash sale for the first time. I received the TV after a week. I got the TV for around Rs.20,000. I prebooked the device for Rs 1000, which gave me two years extended warranty and Rs 1000 amazon cashback. Also, I got Amazon Echo Dot for free and a TV which I returned and got a refund for the same. It was a great deal, and so I decided to go for the OnePlus TV.With an excellent price tag, it comes with some exciting features like OnePlus Connect, Dolby Audio Enhancement, Oxygen Play, Chromecast, Google Assistant built-in and compatible with Amazon Alexa. I was very much excited to unbox and try the OnePlus TV. It also comes with Android 9.0. Unboxing the TV and attaching the table mount was an easy process. Also, setting up the device was very easy.Initial Impressions:When I first started the device, it was lagging a lot. However, there was already a software update available when I just started the device. I quickly updated the device, and the TV was still not working smooth enough. I think going 1 GB RAM is not enough. The picture quality is impressive, and the sound quality isn’t good at default settings. After tweaking the sound, it sounded terrific. Regarding connectivity, it was very smooth. The bezel-less design was the most attractive part of the TV.Design:The design is the most decisive point of the TV. It comes with a bezel-less display, an 88.5% screen to body ratio, and an enhanced viewing experience. It is slim from the back of the TV. Also, the ports are accessible quite easily. The table mount is also of decent quality, and there is a LED indicator in the bottom right corner of the TV. Overall, I loved the design and form factor of the TV.Rating: 4.5/5.Display:The display comes with a bunch of fancy features. It comes with a 1080p resolution and has DCI-P3 93% provides excellent colour reproduction. It uses Gamma Engine for picture enhancement and has features like Anti-Aliasing, Noise Reduction, Dynamic Contrast and colour space mapping. It also comes with various display tweaks such as sports mode, movie mode and many others. But I just tweaked them to get the best out of the TV. The default settings aren’t as good as expected. After tweaking, the colours and overall picture quality is soothing. Although, I think the 60fps doesn’t look smooth enough. It seems like 30-40 fps. To sum up, the display is excellent at this price point, although you need to tweak the settings to get the best out of the display.Rating: 4/5Sound:It comes with a 20W speaker output and also supports Dolby Audio Enhancement. The default sound settings aren’t sounding that great. After tweaking the audio settings, it works at its best. It is loud enough and no complaints apart from default settings.Rating: 4/5Connectivity:We get all the required connectivity options. It comes with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, Ethernet, RF Connection Input, HDMI Input, AV Input, Digital Audio Output and USB Ports. And the most legendary feature is the OnePlus Connect. We can control the TV entirely using a phone, take screenshots of the TV and save and share it. You can also control the TV actions such as volume, switch input, open apps, and turn off TV using Amazon Echo Dot. But there is an issue with the remote. TV won't power on-off-on the first attempt. It also doesn’t have a dedicated input switch button.Rating: 3/5Pros:1)  Awesome colour accuracy, DCI-P3 93% and beautiful display quality.2)  Great sound quality with features like Dolby Audio Enhancement, Dialogue Enhancer, Dolby Surround etc3)  OnePlus Connect App features like taking TV Screenshots, controlling TV etc.4)  Aggressive price point.5)  Amazon Echo Dot integration and Google Assistant Built-In.6)  Bezel-Less display enhances the viewing experience.Cons:1)  It lags a lot at times and especially after turning on the TV from sleep mode.2)  TV won't power on the first attempt 90% of the times.3)  Default Audio and Display Settings aren’t the best.4)  1 GB RAM isn’t enough for the TV.5)  No Wall Mount inside the box.6)  No input switch button on the remote.",back july 2020 oneplus launched budget tv line prebooked tv launch day around two week tv went flash sale first time received tv week got tv around rs20000 prebooked device r 1000 gave two year extended warranty r 1000 amazon cashback also got amazon echo dot free tv returned got refund great deal decided go oneplus tvwith excellent price tag come exciting feature like oneplus connect dolby audio enhancement oxygen play chromecast google assistant builtin compatible amazon alexa much excited unbox try oneplus tv also come android 90 unboxing tv attaching table mount easy process also setting device easyinitial impressionswhen first started device lagging lot however already software update available started device quickly updated device tv still working smooth enough think going 1 gb ram enough picture quality impressive sound quality isnt good default setting tweaking sound sounded terrific regarding connectivity smooth bezelless design attractive part tvdesignthe design decisive point tv come bezelless display 885 screen body ratio enhanced viewing experience slim back tv also port accessible quite easily table mount also decent quality led indicator bottom right corner tv overall loved design form factor tvrating 455displaythe display come bunch fancy feature come 1080p resolution dcip3 93 provides excellent colour reproduction us gamma engine picture enhancement feature like antialiasing noise reduction dynamic contrast colour space mapping also come various display tweak sport mode movie mode many others tweaked get best tv default setting arent good expected tweaking colour overall picture quality soothing although think 60fps doesnt look smooth enough seems like 3040 fps sum display excellent price point although need tweak setting get best displayrating 45soundit come 20w speaker output also support dolby audio enhancement default sound setting arent sounding great tweaking audio setting work best loud enough complaint apart default settingsrating 45connectivitywe get required connectivity option come 24 ghz wifi bluetooth 50 ethernet rf connection input hdmi input av input digital audio output usb port legendary feature oneplus connect control tv entirely using phone take screenshots tv save share also control tv action volume switch input open apps turn tv using amazon echo dot issue remote tv wont power onoffon first attempt also doesnt dedicated input switch buttonrating 35pros1 awesome colour accuracy dcip3 93 beautiful display quality2 great sound quality feature like dolby audio enhancement dialogue enhancer dolby surround etc3 oneplus connect app feature like taking tv screenshots controlling tv etc4 aggressive price point5 amazon echo dot integration google assistant builtin6 bezelless display enhances viewing experiencecons1 lag lot time especially turning tv sleep mode2 tv wont power first attempt 90 times3 default audio display setting arent best4 1 gb ram isnt enough tv5 wall mount inside box6 input switch button remote,0.3697111631537861

I bought it in annual sale and it is nice prodct under this price.Cons: No bootup sound or beep when powered on or used remote so you have to press remote quite hard. Takes good 1-1.5minuts to boot up.Overall verdict - Satisfied with the picture quality and sound quality of product. Could use a notification sound to save my remote though.Amazon installation service is not great as they force you to purchase wall mount stand and charge the installation.  Also the TV was delivered on time but it sat there over the weekend as the installation person could only come after 2days. Moreover they void your warranty if you go for DIY installation or setup which is pretty easy to do.

It may cost more, but you will be happier in the long run. If you are on a budget, look for other cheaper brands. OnePlus just does not have the quality assurance or the service network in place for their TVs.Update: after I posted the above review I called OnePlus support. I had on hold waiting for a rep for a very long time (close to 15 minutes I think), but finally got through.
