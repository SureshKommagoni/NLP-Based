       "'The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Never expected to write a negative review for OnePlus Product !1. Screen Flickering is the most common problem2. Half of the times, TV doesn\\'t start with a single button press.3. Booting takes atleast 20 seconds4. Screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time.5. Audio is dud - Not sufficient for my 10X10 ft bedroom6. System lag is the maximum in this class of TV\\'sEdit: 23/07/2020Amazon declined to replace and offered refund of 19,600/- as against 23k which I paid for the TV. All I have to do now is to live with a defective TV, as I had invested in the wallmount and the allied services. OnePlus SettledEdit: 27/07/2020Product is back in stock. Amazon accepted for replacement after technician report. But, defective product is yet to be picked up and the replacement is yet to be shipped. Awaiting further details. Brand is not at all acting in the customers interest. Very bad response for OnePlus.Edit: 6/8/2020Received the replacement TV from Amazon and the TV if working fine as of now. I installed it on the wall by myself. A bit of lag and sound issues, but the screen stuttering is gone.,TV is beautiful with minute bezels.I was pleased by the picture quality in firstI expected a smooth software from oneplus but TV operation is bit slow probably due to 1gb ram and lower clocked processor. Can\\'t complaint at this price point. Wish oneplus would release better optimized software in update. Software update was one of my reason to buy TV from oneplus.Response from the bluetooth remote was bit slow.But hold bluetooth was very functional. Might be as it is bluetooth 5.0, TV was able to connect to 3+ devices at a time. 1 mobile, 1 bluetooth speaker and remote. That\\'s great.Coming to sound, Speaker quality isn\\'t upto mark. You have multiple options to enhance audio (dolby, surround, presets, dialogue enhancer etc) probably that\\'s the reason oneplus skipped 3.5mm output and opted for optical and HDMI ARC ports to provide quality auido output on external speaker. You should go RCA audio adapters if you want 3.5mm input else connect to speakers using bluetooth adapter. That would cost additional if you want to.If you look for picture quality, minimal design and stick to few ott app this TV is for you.For power users and those who use only 3.5 jack to connect speakers look else where.Update :Oneplus released major update and UI and remote control navigation seems improved now.But setup of new Bluetooth connection got buggy. Im not able to connect to new devices. It is looping back to searching devices after clicking on device after search list,ere is my experience with the Oneplus LAGGY tv32Y model.\\u2028Here is a list of issues with your product.1. connected to Samsung mobile through google home as the tv isn\\'t connecting through Samsung smart view. always says unable to connect, try again. And even through the google home, it is struggling too much to even cast the photos and forget about casting the videos.2. Neither windows nor Mac is recognising The tv in wireless mode. Had to use third party app from play store to Airplay my Mac n gues what, windows is not recognising the tv. It is really shocking to see Mac recognised where Windows couldn’t (using third party play store app).3. To my bad, even through third party play store app, it is laggy half of the times.4. And how can I ignore to say about Oneplus connect app, Its a wonders**t app, do the gesture wait for couple of seconds and then it responds and you can’t access files through the connect app on this tv.5. And sound, it has options by the name, dolby Audio and Dolby digital plus, fix this in your mind, these two features are just names and these does change the sound experience by zero percentage.6. On Youtube, video quality is limited to 1080p, best to use HDMi cable to your happy and play 4K, only then it felt better than any other video quality experience of this tv.7. Opening and closing apps, is like suspense thriller movie scene experience, you will be waiting to know when it will respond.sometimes suspense extends to 3-10 seconds.8. Viewing angles? acceptable for this price.9. Colors? Green is worst of all and then red , black is good, blue colors are worst, yellows are good and the rest that you find are acceptable.10. Display quality? If any of you ever used the Chinese phones of the last decade, you will get the exact same feeling. I promise you this.11. Best option to put  good use of display and colors is to use pen drive, hard disk or HDMI and play the 4k or full HD videos. This is the only way that this display can make you happy.12. And the remote, the menu button literally never worked on  any app nor on home page. It just exists with void function assigned to it.13. Almost forgot about voice search that is google assistance, 10 out of 10 times, it took 3-10 seconds to launch it.14. Opening an app, Fix in your mind that it will take at least 3-10.15. Once you connect Bluetooth accessory, you have to remove the device from the list, if you want to connect it to other device. you will not have an option to disconnect.,I will be brief here.Unboxing:No wall Mount.No Display cables.Plastic stands.Thin TV.Pros:Contrast Ratio is Amazing. Black level is amazing.Viewing angles r fine.Awesome Colour accuracy.Latest Android version.Cons:Poor quality Speakers.Little bit laggy, probably the OS.The panel is awesome, TV won’t lag when playing video, and it’s really okay, android phones have similar issues.As for speakers, why would you use inbuilt speakers?What matters most is Contrast Ratio, Colour range, viewing angles, and clarity.They r all good in this price range, no 20k-35k 43” FULL HD TV could do better.AMAZON INSTALLATION:I didn’t get the wall mount, cause installation guys were charging me for it!TV is good, Amazon Service is getting poorer.,After 10 days usage :1. Display is good not best2. Sound could have been better.3. Gamma Engine Not performed well3. UI is Decent(Modern Lightweight UI).4. Netflix,Amazon Prime YouTube and few apps are Preloaded5. Inbuilt Chromecast Performing Well5. bezels Design perfect6. Best Budget Android Smart TV7. Major advantage of this TV is Google assistant . Works like a charm everywhere and you don\\'t have to type.8. Some Bugs Present in TV OS,First to review 43y1, as my experience with 43 inch So far i liked the Tv.Tv is by default on energy saving picture mode, change to desire mode to get best picture experience, as i changed many picture settings the picture quality is way better than MI & realme me.Sound quality for my living room is more than enough, dolby atmos work carm with my Tatasky HD channels as they support dolby audio.The Lag is fixed to much extent.last input memory is also fixed, TV remembers the last input before switching off.The installation was bit crisp as the guy didn\\'t turn on the promised date, so amazon escalated and yesterday new guy came and installated.Cherry on the cake the installation was free also the wall mount bracket worth Rs500 was provided free by the installation team.Installed and the demo was given very promptly.Also to be noted this 43 inches has different graphic processor than 32 inches G51 Mp3Updating my experience of 4 days -Experienced lag nly twice in 4 days.TV takes a approx of 1 min to get ON.There\\'s a bit motion blur, which would be fixed by update, as it arises due to the DNR in the settings.Sound output is overall good at this range can\\'t expect soundbar like bass.Pre-Book extended warranty has been activated and mail confirmation received from acko.Picture quality is just awesome, with setting proper backlight, contrast etc.Blacks are properly seen black.This has VA panel and i am not much concerned about viewing angles. VA Panels are best for the straight view angle as they produce good contrast and color reproduction,this TV does the same.Viewing angle can\\'t be reviewed from my end as I did see blur when viewd at 150 angle which is obvious for VA panel.Data saver option and alexa support is yet to be updated in this TV.As of now no alexa support for this TV as there\\'s no option to login to oneplus account, so my free echo dot is not of use with this TV as of now, may be they will provide the update to this.Updating my review with some test done1) RGB colour gamat test is performing perfectly on this TV. As you can see computer rgb reproduce proper color.2)motion blur is too much in this TV, expect to be fix via update.3) TV remote is Bluetooth and IR both, i turned of my bluetooth of Remote and using on IR as it\\'s draining battery, when on IR you can\\'t use Google assistant function.4) No support for Echo dot as of now confirmed, hopefully will be in update.5) No data saver option yet.6) backlight bleeding is present at 10% which is common for LED Tv.7) color reproduction is good too.Updating my review to some clarification and my experience 26/071) As echo dot is not compatible and no1 from oneplus has spoken about echo dot compatibility with Y series, i returned my echo dot for full refund.2)Those posting negative reviews due to echo dot not received, kindly add echo dot from cloudtail in cart with oneplus tv, u vll get it for free.3)Those posting negative reviews that after tv return oneplus gave nly 19965 rs, please return your echo dot too they remaining approx 3045rs will be refunded then only.4)I connected my JBl sound bar and watched movies on Prime , I bet the dolby atmos did its work 100%, and its natural u can\\'t expect soundbar sound at 23k.5) pre-book cashback of 1000rs is credited to my amazon pay balance.,I got it delivered by 21 july. Shipping was good but then bright spots started showing from the next day. Product quality isn\\'t good too. I advise you not to buy this oneplus TV\\'s,1. Picture quality is good. Look & Feel is good. I would quote \"Best in this segment TVs.\" I have explored most of the well noted brands in this price segment.2. Sound is 3/5. With Dolby Digital Plus enabled, it is better.3. TV build quality is good, Viewing Angles are good too.4. 4K Videos will be reset to 1080p and this is the maximum resolution for any video.5. Only 4.6GB memory is available out of 8GB.6. Oxygen Play is useless.7. There is bloatware instead of oneplus clean software motto.8. Accessing Tv with Oneplus connect App is 1 out of 5. Its a disaster.9. Wall Mount is free. It will be brought by installation provider, do not shell extra bucks for wall mount or installation.10. Apps take ~10 sec to open, I am expecting optimization over next updates.11. USB Ports doesn\\'t support FAT32 Memory sticks (Pendrive, Hard Disk, or Phone). I am disappointed for this one.12. Max viewing distance can be 8 feet. (My vision is 6/6 for both eyes)13. Though Google Play Store is given, you cannot install even google chrome. I see only Chinese apps are available even in google play store. Don\\'t expect to install apps just like you do it on smart phone.14. No issue with remote and response time is good too. Remote build quality is good too.15. No heating issues noted so far.16. Supports only 2.4 Ghz band WiFi.17. No manual power switch. If remote doesn\\'t work, it will be a hell with Tv.18. Chromecast has ~0.3 sec delay which is very bad if you connect with laptop and work with mouse/touch pad.Suggestion 1: If price is not a issue, go for Samsung or LG.Suggestion 2: Want to enjoy premium experience, buy premium Tv, do not expect to find it from Chinese brands. Time is money, the more time you spend in exploring the options and unboxing videos in YouTube, consider adding that amount to the TV you buy.Hope my review will be a help.,Brilliant TV at affordable price , first sale TV was returned back as it was defective one. Brought it 2nd time. It’s totally worth it!,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Product is on price 13k.  32inch y1Pros.Nice picture quality.Awsm dolby surround soundNo problem with casting with you tubeCons.Croma cast from mobile laging.Connect app not working.Data saver not available in 32 y1After 5 days..After dwnlg oxygen plan from play store croma cast is working without laging.Connect app is also working now.Data saver not found to 32y1,One star because of poor installation serviceI\\'ve received a call of installation guy at 10am he said he\\'ll be at location after 1.5 hour so I said ok please come waiting of him after 2 hours he didn\\'t came & stop picking the call, Suddenly after half n hour again I received the call he asked sir did engineer call you & visit your place I saidhl he called me at 10:00am but he didn\\'t come & even not picking my call I\\'m trying him alot after long conversation of half n hour he arranged another guy he gaves me the contact of another guy again I\\'ve called him he is saying sir I\\'ll be there after 2.5 hour which is completely hard for me too wait I was getting late for office as you know the problem of covid 19 offices fire there\\'s worker well after talk to with him I\\'ve send him location again he called me after 1 hour & said sorry I\\'m not coming o asked why??? Guy\\'s word was talk to my boss... Brother who is your boss??? I would I know again after 15 min. I\\'ve received call again sir I\\'m visiting your place for installation I was surprised that whole Amazon company engineers visiting my home??? Well again 20min he called me & said sir I\\'m not coming wtf??? This whole scene was of 10 am to 2:15pm then finally engineer came 3pm & installated the led the whole wait was of only 4 screws wow amazon please improve your service which is totally sucks I\\'ve missed my office.. led performance is good but the speaker sound is not up to the marks picture quality is good,Tv is awesome at this price.  Among all the competitors in this range of tv , oneplus tv is best.1. Viewing experience2. Sound3. Performance4. FluenceAll this upto mark.I\\'m giving 3 star because of the following reason.1. Oneplus connect app is not working with tv2. I\\'m unable to find any datasaver option3. Available storage is less,Was eagerly waiting for this Tv, it’s economically priced and I got it for 11.7k, super thin and lite weight..!! Thin Bezels and a absolute delight. Audio for a small room is great, bigger room it seems to be quiet less. Been using it whole day, just that one plus connect didn’t work with my iPhone and content from pendrive also not viewable at all, not sure if it’s supposed to be like that or there is some issue with the product.Called one plus customer care, who told One plus connect won\\'t work for iOS, and suggested to long press the home button and select one plus server to connect android and to my surprise iOS also can get connected and works flawlessly.Moving on to the pen drive issue after a lot of research, trial and errors-It works only on the format FAT32.,The video quality is good but  sound quality is average with marginal noise on higher volume. I have viewed Online content and seen DTH tv they  gives true colors and you will truly love it.Dolby sound quality is enough even for living room . For DTH opt for a Dolby supported settop box. I am using airtel xtream box (4k)which is only 2249 for airtel thanks customer .SOFTWARE lags at times and when you select Live TV at times it will not start and gets back to homescreen. Was able to mirror cast through oneplus connect. OnePlus connect app helps to use mobile as remote after the initial update. The viewing angles are ok but this is VA panel so nothing like IPS panel. OnePlus has done good job with regards to video quality as it gives DCI P3 color gamut . Google assistant works fine too. The best thing is the customer service OnePlus offers which is top notch and they listen to you with patience. After sales matter and customer service matter alot in this era. Overall worthy contender.,Bought during first sale on 5th July.This TV is a blot on the name of One Plus, they shouldn\\'t have launched any product with such poor quality.Picture quality is very poor, colors doesn\\'t look natural at all, tried all the color settings. May be good for a monitor but not definitely good as a TV.Sound quality is the biggest setback, it sounds like a 3rd rate speaker and sound isn\\'t balanced. There is no clarity in the sound, you won\\'t be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen.Frame of TV isn\\'t durable, it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute.Summary: Don\\'t expect anything good from this TV, this product doesn\\'t deserve the One Plus brand name. One Plus should recall this product to maintain their brand image.I would have returned this product if there was an option.,Oneplus is settled for this cheap built quality,it comes with plastic body,screen is not at all good,if you pressure you can see liquid like flowing which we see in cheap quality products,sound is too worst,in an olden days when you full the volume you can get bad sound with disturbance now you can experience same with this tv,Ordered on 18th and got it by 20th Afternoon, here\\'s an honest review.But before that, here\\'s a few tips for people who are going to buy it.You\\'ll get an Echo Dot only if you order it with the tv at the same time, read the terms and conditions before leaving one star reviews because you didn\\'t order the echo dot from your end and obviously didn\\'t get it with the TV.To use the One Plus Connect app, you have to update the TV first, the OTA will be there when you turn on the TV for the first time.After that, open the connect server app on the TV, and then open the Connect app on the phone and it would work.Again, do a little research before leaving negative reviews and confusing the potential buyers.The type sync function(use the phone to type on the tv through the Connect App) doesn\\'t work as of now, but would start working in the next app update. Head over to the community forum for the one plus tv to find more details.If you talk about hardware, the TV is flawless, those who are complaining about the TV simply have a bigger room that the TV is designed for. You can always buy a soundbar if you think the volume isn\\'t sufficient for your room. For me, it\\'s more than enough.The display is top notch and the colors are vibrant. It\\'s truly bezel-less and looks beautiful.About the software, there are a few misses here and there, but I\\'m sure it can be fixed through a software update.ScreenCast lags a lot, I\\'m waiting for an update to see if it\\'s fixed.To people who think that the TV lags a lot, think of the TV as a phone with 1 GB RAM, if you keep opening apps repeatedly in a short period of time, the phone would lag, same is the case with the TV.It\\'s a value for money for those who don\\'t wanna spend a fortune to get a TV with a good display.,Firstly I did not receive my Amazon Echo Dot at no cost as promised.So I\\'m really pissed off however I liked the tv, good in quality and sound is pretty loud too.It\\'s absolutely slim and sleek.Beautifully designed.Kudos to designed team.Easy to browse through apps and quick and easy to connect to phone especially one plus phones.Screen cast is just a click away.Gotta do some more research on One Connect App.It\\'s giving me some hard time to connect to the TV.,I bought this TV in the first sale on 5th July and have been loving it. Amazon installation was prompt and it was set up the same day as the delivery. It is pretty light and slim, as given in the specs.The picture quality is fabulous, colors are right and everything about the display is better than normal. As a normal user, you wouldn\\'t notice any point of complaint regards to display.Speakers are loud enough, and we are bound to mostly use it at 25% of the maximum volume. Dolby surrounds sound is an added benefit that does enhance the sound experience of the TV.It runs Android 9.0 out of the box with Oxygen Play as the skin and the UI is pretty simple. It automatically fetches major information from the apps that you add to the home screen given you have signed in if required. The animations and transitions between application is sleek and there is no lag whatsoever. If you have used an android phone, the UI is no alien and the navigation will seem very familiar.The connectivity ports provided are ample and the WiFi reception is also pretty strong. I don\\'t know about the bells and whistles that other TVs come equipped with, but as a normal user who wants to enjoy his shows, videos, and cinema on a smart TV from all the contemporary sources like prime video, Netflix, youtube, etc., this is the perfect option.,It just got delivered on the second day of sale,fixed also, installation was done above 6 feet,1.Sound quality is not good.2.Remote is not actual bluetooth as it doesn\\'t sense 100%.3.With this price range we could have gone with the other brands.4.Only buy if you are 1+ lover other wise its not worth..,Overall Analysis and Reviews for all prospective buyers -1. Picture Quality -The TV is definitely a worthy purchase as its Picture Quality is by far the best in class in compared to other competitors.Build Quality too is Good.The bezel and screen is definitely a Masterpiece as the Bezels are indeed Minimum & the way the screen is built is extremely Unique and different than other competitors.Can\\'t comment on Viewing Angles as honestly I am not an expert also most people watch TV directly in straight direction and all these Viewing Angles talk is just a gimmick to confuse you all.2. OSEarlier reports were that the TV is very laggy especially w.r.t 32inch however I did not experience much lag. One needs to understand that in this segment all competitors offer similar config of Ram and Processor which are definitely not high-end HOWEVER like how it has been hyped on Lag part .. I found it to be rather untrue as Lag exists but not to a huge extent.OnePlus own software optimization is amazing as really clean and bloat free.The TV remembers the last input and so turns on by default on the said input mode on boot-up.Tv has a unique style of Boot Up and Shut down method as on single power off press it seems TV is more on standby mode and only on Long Press of power off will the TV shutdown completely.Boot up timing is good as its not too delayed.3. Sound - Major let down as sound is definitely not at all.upto the mark however this is problem which is common amongst all competitors as each hv low Quality speakers only.I already have a soundbar so this aspect anywhich ways had 0 impact as all competitors fail in sound aspect in these cost segment of TVs totally per my experience.4. Accessibility of Ports - Perhaps the major let down for me are the accesibility of the ports as they are not at all User Friendly and not readily accessible specially for people who have opted for Wall Mount like in my case.The downward location of Port is the most Negative aspect for me.However as I hardly use ports much so again not a major impact however for others it can seem to be a problem mainly for users who have more requirements of port like hdmi and all however with an HDMI extender you will be good to go just an investment of 200-300 rs for an extender may be required.Table Top installation people have nothing to be worried off. This is least concern for them.5. Connectivity - Though a single band wifi Router Exists, the same works absolutely fine and 0 loss or issues atleast till now.6. Installation - Installation was a bit challenge mainly due to screw-up by Third party responsible for installation however with Amazon Escalation it was handled timely and despite hiccups TV was installed on the scheduled date only by EOD.There\\'s a lot of confusion with regards to Wall Mount, well let me be clear that Wall Mount is totally Free and nothing needs to be paid at all.Beware that Installation guy may make some charge and ask to pay however fight back, escalate, talk to their Manager or ask for official bill and you will be good to go as nothing will be charged then.Only lack of clarity remains is around the type of Wall Mount used, as in my case , the guy used an generic brand wall Mount bracket and it is not at all clear whether Oneplus has their own branding of Wall Mount.. Maybe others can add-on.7. Remote - Remote design and all is pure beauty with minimalistic design however dont know where the issue seems to be with Remote or otherwise as it could be like at-times mutilple times pressing could be required especially to Turn On the Tv. Not sure whether its remote lag or otherwise - Maybe Oneplus can fine tune with update.Overall Analysis & Recommendation -Tv is definitely highly recommend for people priority and focus is Picture Quality and OS (highly recommended for OTT users like me) .Bedroom TV - Best Choice 💯If you have soundbar then don\\'t think otherwise as its the best option from others outhere literally.MI TV and All completely fail in comparison to this.Got free Echo Dot too.. Many complained of not getting as they did not read the offer properly as the speaker needs to be added in cart along with TV inorder for promo to apply automatically.TV is not Alexa based and so could not completely reap the benefits of the same with Echo however maybe with update this could be sorted too.Also for OTT users like me it should have an option that on Boot-up TV starts at Google Launcher page only - Again update can take care of this .A word of advice for all confused buyer\\'s - read my above detailed guide and then take a call.Nevertheless, you won\\'t be regretted at all with this TV. OnePlus has definitely delivered its premiumness with this TV for sure and which is highly visible too.Will update the reviews if add-on or change of facts.What more are you looking out for .. simply buy this TV.Never Settle !!!😍,No audio out for the TV never tust a new brand on an entry level...if picture quality is your only pripority then go for it because that sound is worst as hell.. I don\\'t consider price point because 13000 is not a small amount for many people. I planned to connect it to a external.speaker but the port is missing. No digital audio.out nor the traditional 3.5mm out. Highly disappointed in audio category..,Absolute Disaster.....1. Echo Dot was free along with the product. But I got to know that it needs to be added while ordering. But when something is free with order, why it is required to be added. Simply to fool people.Very disappointed with Amazon this time. Really really bad.2. There is a blue flash which appears while the tv is on repeatedly.3. Sound is the worst you can think of.Overall a bad decision. Both Oneplus and Amazon have been disappointing.,Very nice Tv in this price range from one plus.Picture quality is superb...Sound quality is ok ok but better than MI TV\\'sBuilt quality is also goodTv looks premium because of Bezel less design.Remote controller is also made of good quality plastic and it is very good looking, hotkeys are provided for Netflix, Prime video, YouTube and Google Assistant.Overall it\\'s very good and budget Tv from brand like one plus compared to MI , Realme, VU, Thomsan etc.,Looks Great. Colours are Amazing. However, user Experience is not refined at all for Oneplus standard and even for any other standards for that matter. Will edit the review once OnePlus fixes below issues.Below are some of the bugs I observed in the last 2 days. Needs immediate attention from OP Software Team to protect OP\\'s reputation.1) Very laggy interface across all apps including home screen, play store, voice assistant. Netflix etc.2) When the TV is off, power button had to be pressed couple of times before the TV could turn on3) When the TV is off, Bluetooth keeps connecting back and disconnecting from TV (Alexa keep saying got connected to Oneplus TV every few mins when used as a external speaker even when TV is off)4) TV also takes time to register inputs from OP Connect app. No keyboard on OP connect app. After restart again need to open Connect app on TV for OP Connect app on mobile to detect OP TV.5) Customize Channels on the homescreen keeps getting reset6) Even when no input is connected to the TV, the TV boots to one of the inputs (HDMI/Channel Scan) instead of home screen.7) Menu button hardly has any use on home screen and only works when used with external inputs.8) There is no option to adjust colours/sound in realtime with hardware remote (i.e.while watching media on TV)9) Alexa app does not recognize the TV even after adding and linking Account in Oneplus TV skillI guess can\\'t be fixed with Software but still want to capture for records (While watching from straight gives great picture quality in the class, viewing angles are pretty bad compared to competition),Got this tv as a cheap and small entertainment unit for my bedroom. Below are the quick pointers:Pros:1. Overall design is very sleek with almost non-existent bezels on three sides. Back mount is available, along with two plastic feets that hold the tv up nice and firmly however you install it. Enough connectivity options incl HDMI arc, optical, spdif and they work as intended.2. Standard smart remote with Netflix, Prime, YouTube and Google assistant buttons. Please note that you have to pair the remote with the tv for the first time before you can use the Bluetooth mode (search in web).3. The display is pretty good with excellent color accuracy though there\\'s no HDR/Dolby Vision support. However, I\\'ve seen the HDR implementation in cheap TVs, and I\\'d rather have overall bright and uniform screen which this tv provides. Minimum backlight bleeding. Slight loss of brightness at high angles of viewing but pq remains same.4. Sound quality is pretty average, but loud. It\\'s good enough for a 10/10 room but at more than 50% volume, the dialogues become difficult to understand. I\\'ve heard the speakers in other sub 30k sets and this one is definitely among the top 3.5. Inbuilt Android 9 OS is pretty good, have access to almost all the entertainment apps that work out of the box. There\\'s a bit of lag at times when switching apps and scrolling the menu but it\\'s not too distracting.6. Works great with Google home and offers full voice control. Inbuilt Chromecast is fast and connects quickly. You can also cast video from laptop using Chrome/VLC/other cast apps.Cons:1. Only 768p though YouTube will go to full hd. Given the price point, it\\'s fair, but a full hd panel would\\'ve been worth more to both consumers and company. At close distance, you can see the LEDs but more than 3ft, you\\'re game.2. No 5ghz WiFi band support, but that\\'s alright because sub hd content will not need more than 5-10mbps at max. Channel congestion can be a problem if you have too many devices connected to the 2.4ghz band, so keep that in mind.3. Remote lags a bit post cold startup. Especially in apps like Hotstar. Maybe software update will fix.,This is the worst product by oneplus. I ordered this bcoz I\\'m a big fan of Oneplus smartphones and used every smartphone of oneplus so I thought this led will also be amazing. But as I received the product -Speakers were not working👎No WiFi connection was enabled 👎So the guy who visited to Install this, marked as defected.Again when I received the replacement, now the display was not working properly. So I returned this. 👎Only the good thing is the delivery by amazon which is very fast. 👍,Worst ever product from OnePlus. Remote not working properly. Whenever I\\'m trying to switch on the tv using the remote it never responds. Even OnePlus care didn\\'t provide any solution for this issue. Amazon provided a replacement but the problem still persist. Hence returned.,One Plus name say about its premium brand +Echo DotAudio Quality is good enough, Visual are very good, Software not lagged any where.Fixed wall mount free of cost.Instruction: On1st time turning on your Android TV dont  add google account  and location settings instantly  give some time to set up the device..I didn\\'t see and lag and hanging issue.Later 1 hour of normal TV usage I tried to setup my google account and later I I updated my system to next version without any single lag tv working smoothly.No connectivity issue...Moreover Android tv of Oneplus in 23k range with b.less display is awesome.Echo Dot reached on separate courier the 2nd day of my online order ....working good and worth for 3.4kI\\'ll again post review after 50 days.,Tv ordered on 5th July, received on 8th July, but installation service not done by Amazon till now , they told me and mailed me your TV installation done by 8th July between 2pm to 6pm, but when I received the TV  from delivery person, within 5 minutes I got a mail from Amazon, your tv installation reschedule on 22nd July. I am shocked, then I called to Amazon, what ther told your area restriction for visit, when the ristrication once lifted we Will arrange your Tv installation service. Then I told him before 2 day you sent a mail to me your installation done by 8th July, now I received the tv , suddenly you telling me your tv installation rescheduled on 22 of July, after that no response from Amazon, I called OnePlus care about that problem 2 Times also OnePlus told me u can contact to Amazon, we can\\'t do anything from here, Amazon will help you, After that I felt upset, I think no one help after sell, then I decided I will cancel that tv, then I cancelled. So don\\'t buy one plus Tv, Also Tv ratings not good , Overall rating 3.4*, so please go for VU cinema TV, best tv under 13,000 , also Samsung, Motorola u can go for these TV\\'s,,Based on a real incident.At first remote\\'s down arrow button was not working. I was so not in a good mood. I hit the remote with my hand(just like all Indians do) . it started working.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0No doubt TV is value for money but has few small issues.1. It doesn\\'t gets on with single press of power button on remote.2. It is a bit slow because of 1GB RAM.3. Sound quality is not a expected.Few people mentioned about not receiving free echo dot. I got it for free just you need to add it to cart with TV and at checkout they will give a full discount for echo dot.,Display quality is top notch. Even though it\\'s FHD. And for the sound quality. I also had issue with it. But first go in sound setting and turn on surround sound and dolby sound. And then feel the real sound this TV can provide. Earlier i had an issue with TV not being able to turn on by remote. But after reading the manual i cane to know that to turn on TV it uses IR blaster on remote like old days unlike bluetooth. So u have to point it directly to the right bottom of the TV. A splendid purchase for the price. Really happy. And the display is really punchy and colour accurate.,Again good quality product deliver by oneplus . I m using mi tv past 2 years with lot of lagging while app to launcher switch. This tv has no problem faced still now . Remote working smoothly . Picture quality good .If u switch dolby digital plus, the  Sound quality of tv speakers is good. Also I connect ant sound bar to tv is amazing ( not great in mi tv ) . After update oneplus connect and chromecast working awesome. Tv valuable your money u wont regret....,Did a mistake of pre ordering it without even waiting for the review.1. The picture quality is not that great2. The interface has too much lags3. Audio quality is also not Upto the mark4. But has some of the coolest features5. Cannot complaint for 13k but expected a bit more improved product from oneplus ,I mean that’s what they are known for ; their speed and it certainly lacks in this tv.,Wast of money,It\\'s not a good tvSub standard product,picture was just ok.very slow interface.sound is very awful.if you look for a good tv.pls only buy prominent brands tv.very much disappointed with this purchase.,Writing after a months review.Bought this TV as just to test !Amazing powerful small TV,  32 inch with nice picture quality. It does what it says....Most importantly it works amazing with Amazon Prime, Hotstar etc...Many TVs in this segment claim to be smart , but fail to perform. Surprisingly, TV tv is indeed a powerhouse which works without any lag..! Amazing work by OnePlus with just 1GB RAM.Honestly speaking, no TV can offer what this TV is offering in this price range !I have nothing to complain about this TV.,When picture move fast then this TV not Handel picture quality.This TV sell without basic testing.On news channel button of TV news headline moving not Handel blur.Brightness feel your eye bad.Investment 1 or 2k more and buy lg TV.,HONEST REVIEW AFTER USING FOR 2 DAYS.I received the TV on the date mentioned, inspite of the travel restrictions as my address was listed in a containment zone. Good job by the Amazon delivery in Kollam (Kerala).The product is really worth the money you spend. All features mentioned work. You just have to update it first. \"Picture quality\" is excellent. Chromecast (Screencast) works fine. OnePlus Connect works (you have to follow the instructions in the app). All apps are working fine( Hotstar, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Netflix).You can connect the Echo Dot to this Television and it works perfectly fine.\"Sound quality\" is more than average compared to the negative reviews that have been mentioned. It is more than enough for the television. It will depend/vary on the platform you are using to view the videos.The Wall Mount was installed by the Service staff and they came at the correct time as agreed.OVERALLI am more than happy with the product. I was a bit skeptical about the product after ready all the negative reviews. But I have received a good product and it meets all the specifications mentioned by OnePlus. Great job by OnePlus in coming up with a budget TV.,When I purchased this tv there is a offer of eco dot is free with it but they do legal fraud with customers which we can\\'t do any think. Even when I said to customer center for writing complaint but they said we can\\'t write complaint bcz we didn\\'t violet terms and conditions it\\'s really bad from Amazon India but about one plus tv picture quality is much better, sound is ok ok over all tv is good with this price range.,Average picture qualityBelow average sound qualitySometimes lagy software (hope fix next update)No issue on connectivityOveral worth for 13kInstallation...Very bad installation service for TVS EThey are aoutomaticaly change date to 5 timesNo customer support from amazon and oneplusAfter 5 times complaint,,,,Installation done..Poor service,Chronology of events:-==================22-Oct-20: Ordered and Amazon Delivered OnePlus Y Series 108cm(43inches) TV23-Oct-20: Installation was doneThe TV had issues as display goes blank, sound gets distorted after connecting with bluetooth, volume goes missing when TV is turned on.29-Oct-20: Technician visit request was raised within 10 days validity .31-Oct-20: Technician visited and checked the issue and further confirmed that issue exists in the TV but did not provide any Job Order/Receipt.I was unable to place a request for return/refund and did multiple follow ups with the technician again to share Job Order/Receipt but he refused and later did not pick up my call.I reported this incident to Amazon Call Support, and they asked me to open another service request due to inconvenience by the service provider and the return/refund of the product remains valid as the technician visit request was made within 10 days.31-Oct-20: 2nd time, Technician visit request was raised.01-Nov.-20: I did Follow Up-1 with Amazon Call Support and assured that technician will contact me within 24hrs.; but no success.02-Nov.-20: No response/visit from Technician.02-Nov.-20: I did Follow Up-2 with Amazon Call Support who contacted the service provider and assured that technician will contact within 48hrs.; but no success.05-Nov.-20: Still No response/visit from Technician.05-Nov.-20: I did Follow Up-3 with Amazon Call Support who asked me to open/re-schedule the technician visit request and the issue was explained and he transferred the call to Amazon Technical Support and issue was again explained and he transferred the call to Amazon TV Appliances Support and issue was again explained and he assured that installation team/ technician will contact within 48hrs, else I should again report the technician no show with Amazon Call Support.

At this price this is the best. Picture quality is fabulous. Apps work fine. Only it lags a bit, don\\'t use it for gaming. Only  for  viewing  TV.,Great product again from oneplus.picture quality is superb, screen size and picture ratio is best in this range. Sound quality is ok when u compare it with vu cinema which have 40w speakers. But all in all nice TV in this range from oneplus.,It could not even run for 3days and now I am not getting a refund/replacement,Update after using for more than A month - very late response and also laggy device kindly think before buying this one !! I have oneplus 8 mobile still doesn\\'t work hassle free it\\'s too slow Remote response is almos 4-5second late!!no wall mount was provided by the oneplus.. nor was available with the installation team.. had to use my old wall mount.. all over happy.. pls mention for wall mount (additional charges) if required before the installation guy comes,Display quality is excellentsound is okconnectivity with ott apps are little bit slowno screen mirror option only chrome cast but you can do the job with an additional device via hdmi portfinally to say worth for price in this segmentTv installation service become a bit challenge in my area,Quite satisfied with the product for the price range.For people complainting about lag issue, its nothing to do with ram ir storage Just pair the remote with bluetooth. By default remote works with ir which needs a straight line of sight. Once you pair it as bluetooth it works like a charm.To pair the remote with bluetooth, just go to setting in tv and click on Remote and Accessories. Adter that click left and home key simultaneously on remote. It will be paired and no lag issue will be there,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Loving the picture quality and the thin bezels.Wasn\\'t expecting great sound from the reviews but am surprisingly satisfied from the output for my room.All the OS features working after the update.Oneplus connect was not that useful till now.The remote is nice.,The packaging was simple and easy to unpack. As mentioned in the description the packaging includes TV, remote, user manual (warranty included), AAA battery. Wall mount is not included.The TV is very slim, light weighted and easy to setup. Display looks good, sound is fine. Operating the tv is easy too.,Audio stopped working after 15 days and One Plus is not supporting and asking to contact Amazon, not sure who will help with this. One of problems buying online products.,Full HD 1080p video picture good,Sometimes remote is not responding well,Sound could\\'ve been better,New app install,update, uninstall are very easy,Also have Some pre-installed app,which is not uninstallable.Overall good tv, better than Mi.,This product is very good and excellent sound quality..don go with the negative review ..this product is just awesomeThe review in youtube and other social media platforms are totally wrong.I personally used this tv .,I got 32 y last Wednesday itself came in good package, no issues with Amazon or OnePlus packages, picture and sound is dope even it connected easily with my LAN and phone.,The TV is good for the price you pay. We things that I would like to suggest/bring it to notice1. This not yet compatible with Alexa2. sound output is average, would recommend a sound bar to enhance sound quality (try Blaunpaunkt SB-100)3. Picture quality is good - few backlight bleeds. You will need to set it to correct color setting to have a good viewing experienceRest is good! Hoping Oneplus would give OTA updates to resolve few things,It\\'s disappointing to see that sound was not something one plus put their efforts to improve, fortunately I didn\\'t get a laggy TV mine works fine although power on and off with the remote is tricky and build quality is the lowest I expected, there are haps everywhere very low quality body. Have to be very fragile while moving it, although having these problems I don\\'t think I will return the product. But still to play a game with a brand image of one plus, it really did some damage this time. I won\\'t recommend this if you are saving up for an immersive experience it lacks some of the basics of TV requirment.,Great deal although little bit disappointed for speaker but in this price range its worth itTips: buy prime membership before buying this tv its worth it😂,The first time I\\'m writing against one plus, the way one plus brand its image is great, but when it comes to Television section it\\'s worst. It\\'s just 2 days y series 3w inches tv has gone wrong with its technical issues, where the wifi is not getting connected, smart tv without wifi connectivity is as waste as it is. After raising complaint to one plus tv 2 days back yet no one responded. I suggest everyone\\'s go ahead with mi 32 better price best quality as my cousin uses it from one long year.Amazon was best at service recently even it turned out to be worst.After delivery of defect product, still amazon wabt back up and make Customer feel terrible on service as returns the product.Amazon dosent have option to retun money, abd they won\\'t pace up in service too. Post collection of tv amazon tele representative says it will take 10 days to get deliver new one.I dint understand why I\\'ve to wait after paying 15k and getting defective. Amazon tele representative says be patience, cos of this guy\\'s service it\\'s creating mental agony, worst service from Amazon and worst product from one plus. Two big brands loosing their image.,Great picture quality, good sound(lacks the bass effect, but Dolby audio enhances the sound), best tv in the price segment. Don\\'t think twice, just go for it.,1) product is made in india2) Picture quality -  super3) Sound - super4) Connectivity - super ( no buffering prime or Netflix or YouTube ) Feels like theatre experienceWon\\'t work proper with OnePlus phone to OnePlus tv lags too muchWorth buying @12,999/-,Picture quality is best with super colorsSound is not upto the mark...tried bass but it\\'s ok for 20W also tried surround sound it\\'s ok.Checked screen cast..lil bit of delay in it.Hope you find this helpful. 🙏,Excellent features and working also perfect.best tv on budget simply buy it,I got this TV on 5th Sept. After 16 days, both the HDMI ports stopped working. I have initiated the warranty claim by Amazon three times but it has been 10 days and no one came to repair the TV. Worst service by amazon. I am a prime customer but now I regret. Talking to a lot of people and asking them to Visit Amazon to give honest reviews on all the products. There is a lot going behind the bars now and quality has reduced drastically.,Best TV at this price available in market no complaints about it every thing is good and fantastic 👌 only thing is you need OnePlus or Apple device to connect to oxygen play but you can also access it on the TV so no issues,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Everything is just Perfect Except Sound quality.Bass lovers should buy soundbar to experience this amazing Product.,Best priceGood pictureGood screenI hate soundsSpeaker not goodTemple speaker thu,Simple and nice tv with loads of features in small budget happy with the quality and performance , thank you Amazon and one plus for delivering the best beast tv.😇,Everything is just amazing. Only OnePlus connect is useless. But it\\'s ok. When you have normal remote. You really don\\'t need that stupid application. Please go ahead and buy it. You can trust amazon and the installation company to help you during any ups and down. They are really helpful. Installation is free and wallmount is also free. You don\\'t have to pay 1 rupee also. If you don\\'t ask them to put new switch board or wiring or something. They will come drill 2 holes and put the mount and will go. Simple and easy.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Bought this product on October 2020.Tv was quite impressive in the beginning and picture quality was also good.On April 2021 tv screen got black, sounds are coming but no visual.(technician told panel issue)It\\'s been 2 months but my tv problem is not yet resolved .Let\\'s see whether tv will be repaired or not under warranty duration. I hope Amazon will help me out ASAP.#oneplus #amazon #qdigiI will update my feedback guys about warranty promises shared by OnePlus group. Whether it is real or painful.I hope I will not lose my trust from OnePlus brand. They will sort this out and help me too.ThanksAbhishek,Got defective PC. The same has been informed the TV Installer.Dead pixel and damaged on bezel.Don\\'t purchase this.,after using couple of weeks, i am writing this review/my opinionOnePlus TV is similar in to MI TV , VU TV , Realme TV, Motorola TV in terms of functions and performance.there is no brand mark on the TV. I am neither happy nor sad.Don\\'t wait for the flash sale. go for any TV all are same,Didnt expect from oneplus ... bad sound quality... lags ... aftr 10 days appers lines on tv ... i cant return tv bcoz return period is over .... very worst build ... please dont buy,Remote conectivity is slow and sound clarity is some less rather than tv is amazing super extraordinary tv nice in budget,Too slow with lag due to less RAM. Did not expected this from OnePlus. Avoid buying this one.,Overall it\\'s a good TV for the price. I got the 43\" TV , echo dot and 3 years of warranty.I did find it a bit laggg initially, but seemed better after the first update. The wall mount took an additional ₹800.,Like this tv very much. Better picture quality, good sound and connection. Floor stand distance is high so couldn\\'t accommodate in my small TV table. Sometimes prime get restart automatically. Otherwise it\\'s a pakka product.,Thumbs up for timely delivery and installation for Amazon.Review after 10 days.Picture quality is good and for the price is great. As got 3500rs. Echo dot and 2years extended warranty.,It\\'s looking very good till now... However i installed it on my own... Installation is pretty late by delivery,Tv is looking great physically and also its interface easy to useOnly one problem i am facing that  is connecting the tv to the settop box through hdmi 2 port always mute the audio after power on but hdmi 1 arc port is working fine . Also i cannot control the volume of the tv in the settop box using settop box remote on Dolby mode,I purchased this only for the brand name. You get a woww factor when you say you have one plus Tv.Other than that it is pretty normal TV for this price range. You get cheaper (1-2k) Tv from Thompson, Mi and VU for this price range. So you are actually paying 1k for this brand value and nothing else as the specs and performance match with other Tv brands.Display quality is very good and sound could have been better, these are on par with other TV on this same price range. Down firing speakers make sound little muffled.Casting works perfectly in both android and iPhone. Airtel Xrteam or jio live tv app is not available for any TV models but you can run it on phone and cast it to TV. So you don’t have to purchase a DTH or cable with smart TV with built in chromecast.TV does become slow when you open multiple apps but this is problem in all budget Tv models.2 hdmi ports is not a problem at all. As mostly you would only use 2 ports. 1 for dth and 1 for playstation. Since moving to OTT we no more use DVD or blue ray players. Also chromecast is inbuilt, so there is really no need for 3rd hdmi cable.,Nice productPicture quality is awesomeIn budget of 23k it\\'s good to buy and u get echo dot freeAnd if u purchase the extra waranty it is free with itIf u don\\'t add echo dot while purchasing then u will not recieve with tv u have to add to cart during purchasing with tv then checkout for paymentScreen cast is laggy. Sound quality is ok.,Great product at 11600..after card discount..Amazing panel and color depth..Go for it..wont regret,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Nice quality,picture quality\" is 4/5 ,\"value for money\" is 4/5 & \"sheerness\" is 4/5 all over.1. OnePlus Connect App feature is good2. Remote is outstanding 9/10. Sometimes menu app is not work3.Google Assistant is only work perfectly on YouTube \"Not work properly in full led .4.Perfectly view from 10m away & sound surrounding.5.Media Album feature only available for OnePlus phone user.6. Screenshot Feature is also outstanding 👍* All over good for experience android tv of ONEPLUS Y1.,Awesome product😍😍😍,Returning TV. Do not think to buy. A very bad product from Oneplus. Find following flaws after using TV for a couple of days.1. TV getting hang quite often.2. Very slow processor3. Remote is slow. Sometimes command do not reach the TV4. Very bad build quality. Cheap material used.5. No buttons in TV set apart from Power.6. Bluetooth does not works properly.7. Oneplus and amazon technical team dont have knowledge about the product.8. Bluetooth Speaker/headphone do not connect automatically. It require to unpair everytime to re-connect.9. Sound quality not upto thr mark.Not expected this from Oneplus.,TV is very good at this price. Installation was not done by the service provider. As promised by Amazon, Eco dot was not provided along with the TV.,This was not accepted from OnePlus.I bought this 32\" tv on it\\'s first sale.Picture Quality : is like LCD tv, not Like LED tv.Sound Quality: is not comfortable to ear. Need more concentration to hear sound to understand the words.Design: Design is goodRemote: Remote is also goodNeed an update to fix this issue but if it is a LCD tv then no update can fix the picture quality of this tv.Hope for the best,This is fantastic tv ever. please do not trust any bad review i personally loving it.there is not any lag issue.,Very slim and best tv under 13k,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I am a OnePlus user since 2015. Never expected these sort of cheap quality product from OnePlus.Tv stopped working after 2 months. Display is blank now.  OnePlus service is pathetic.  They are not responding even 2 weeks after raising the complaint. Don\\'t waste money on this Crap.,Expected a lot... but basic things not functioning1. The Jio 5G connection doesn\\'t get listed and hence cannot be selected.2. The connect app doesn\\'t connect3. Though Chromecast is available I have been unable to cast anything4. Sound is not smooth,Remote sensitivity is very low when compare to Mi tv. Its ver hard for me to change the channel,Had an extremely poor experience with OnePlus TV.TV screen turns black on random occasions but frequently, it again turns back on in 30sec to 5 min.Sounds stops working similarly.Picture turns green randomly.This doesn\\'t feel like a OnePlus product. Even local brands provide better products.After all this, i applied for replacement and then amazon scheduled an inspection service and the inspection guy didn\\'t show up. Had to rescheduled it two more times but no one shows up. Contacted amazon and told the whole scenario then they replaced it directly.Got the replaced product but the issues are still there and this time the product feels like second hand. Only that this time the issues ka worse and more frequent that last one.Filed a return request, again got inpection service scheduled and after explaining previous experience to customer care, this time got a call from inspection guy. He made a video of the issue. He said that he has verified the issue but I did not receive any response from Amazon regarding this.And the worse thing, Amazon is not providing customer care support now. Tried multiple times but didn\\'t recieve any call from Amazon. Feeling stuck with this defective product.Won\\'t be using Amazon for a long time now.Update: After initiating the return order again, Amazon sent people for picking up the defective item. Now waiting for refund initiation.,Excellent picture quality,Best Primium look.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I\\'m one OnePlus fan always, TV in this low bedget is very good. Sound quality need improvement. Picture quality is good and over all value for money.,Good product.worth buying at this price point.picture quality is awesome.sound is good.but no bass.Bezzle less design is Good.Worth buying at this price.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0It\\'s awesome tv at 13k, except for viewing angles.It\\'s color production and lookwise it\\'s unmatchable.From front on it matches any full HD TV, interface is smooth.Color production is really good, blacks are really black like OLED panelFrom sides it\\'s colors fade is noticable, it\\'s the only but big negative from OnePlusWhen it comes to sound it is good while streaming through apps like YouTube, hotstar,, with set of box it\\'s bit low.No lag in OS, remote is easy to operate and premium look.After 6 months usage , it\\'s going great and really satisfiedAfter almost 1 year usage I\\'m satisfied with this TV , picture quality is of high class, one issue noticeable is there is a 3 mm gap at the base frame, not a major concern but OnePlus need to take care.If you are using it only with set of box use a good hdmi cable , it will really enhances viewing experience. With AV cables you will get very poor picture quality.It\\'s one year of moderate use , but I\\'m getting back light issues on screen, currently it\\'s not a issue while watching , but if it continues to intensity it will be a issue, I didn\\'t expect that within a year.,Awesome picture quality 👌. Sound settings is little bit tricky otherwise you will get low quality audio output. No lagging found while using apps. With echo dot I think it\\'s a good deal,Picture quality is very good compare to others tv in this budgetSound is extremely goodPremium lookMust buy this tv in this budget ☺️☺️,Excellent picture quality, value for money,Oneplus Case ID: J0ZMESTF5TPQ.We purchased Oneplus TV in 2020 July , TV had issues with sound quality but picture quality is fine .after 8 months of use,  suddenly display become dark in May 2021 and no visual. We had complained the issue in one plus customer care(literelly you need to wait for 30 min)  , after 2 weeks engineer arrived home in June 2021, after screening, he confirmed that display need to be replace.. He ordered for part in June 2021..till now we have made 100s of calls to customer care, twitter handle (this guy\\'s really robots asking same information again n again) but no one turned on.. Litterelly we are in home without TV. Bloody oneplus post sales.. I would strongly suggest you not to buy oneplus TVs. Better go with old brands.. Just belive me, otherwise you will be in soup.Oneplus Case Reference ID: J0ZMESTF5TPQ,Don\\'t buy this tv. I am really disappointed. Not worthable.,Bezel less display, worthy of money, dedicated TV OS ,,1 week use reviewPros:1. Picture quality- good, you need to try different mode like for watching movie try Movie mode, for sports use sports mode.2. Bezel are really very less at this price.3.truely smart- download one plus connect and use your mobile as a mobile. \" First update the TV\\'s software, after that no slowness in software. You can cast mobile screen with this amazing software one plus connect.4. No issues in casting from youtube, Amazon, even Gaana to play songs.5.Remote is what it should be like, all necessary keys no useless keys.ConsSound could be little better but it is still better than my old sony Bravia.Rest all is good.,Awesome sounds, connectivity & Picture Quality in this price.. love it. Thanks Amazon & OnePlus.,Very nice quality overall.Best tv to buy under 15k,Very nice picture and sound quality , sometimes flicker if redmi cable is close but the installation service is very bad,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Respected viewer,I know before purchasing this expensive leisure you will be viewing the rewievs let me tell you this TV has a great picture quality and smart features but this crashed in just 3 days of use . I purchased this TV long time back and it was kept in one corner of my house and then after a hell lot of scams one fine day a totally unprofessional fellow came to install it ...... After damaging the whole wall with innumerable drills he installed it and didn\\'t even explain the features which , somehow , we got to know about.....then he charged the double price for the wall mount.....then after thousands of complaints finally we got a refund. Would suggest to buy from a showroom. Hope you find it helpful but informally would like to tell if you don\\'t want to fall in any sort of problem .... Then please don\\'t purchase this product !Have a good day,Wonderful picture quality . Easy to operate but one plus connect app doesn\\'t work. Volume is not that much. But it\\'s worth it for the price it comes under,Price is reasonable, picture quality is good. Connectivity also good, remote is small and good, sound is ok, need to explore more, bazzle is almost negligible.. Looks good,In this price you can\\'t ask for more.Awesome picture quality , a bit slow operating system else everything is good.,Just Amazing🤩😍Best in the segmentNo competition with thisGreat Colors and bezel less display.,Amazing,OnePlus tv is best....but amazon courier faciliti is very very bad...I am very irritating for wating this product...,For this much price we can say TV is good in every aspect. But there is a lagging problem. It\\'s taking time to open any app.,I am not too happy with this one. I had huge expectations. Too much of LED bleeding issues and patches across the panel. I am awaiting an inspection from Amazon. So hoping for a replacement soon. Initial overview, price wise a good deal, if my panel issue gets resolved. But if you don\\'t consider the price, this comes nowhere near to a Samsung panel.,The most horrible thing about this tv is its remote control . Very much irritating you to press the button 3-4 times to change something , not expected this from one plus . Although this tv has a good picture quality , average sound clarity and a decent bezel - less display . It can be said a value for money product . But the remote connectivity and performance is awful.,Waiting since last 1 year for 43 in TV. Finally able to purchase. More value for less money.,Happy with product,Value for money,Screen is bit delicate except tht everything is fine awesome design,so far so good...,If you\\'re going to purchase this product make sure you have atleast 4gb / day data plan dedicated to this TV.Also you need a WiFi router for getting full functionality.Let me start with the pros1. Picture quality is great. You\\'ll need some Tweeks though. Set it on movie preset for day time use. Energy saving for night time use. I reduced backlight to 20 and it\\'s in user mode to reduce eye strain.2. Audio quality is good. You also need a lot of Tweeks though.Set it in movie preset if you\\'re watching movies. This preset let\\'s you hear all the music details also you\\'ll hear the dialogues crystal clear. In this mode you won\\'t hear bass that much. You\\'ll get a hint of base nothing much. Because base will affect the Dialogues.Set it in music preset if you\\'re listening to music in this preset you\\'ll hear all the highs and lows crystal clear. You\\'ll get bass as well.Okay now discuss about the consEverything else in this TV is a con.It has data saver installed but you can\\'t able to access it. Data savers has an update in playstore. For some reason it\\'s not updating.You can\\'t use this TV as a Bluetooth speaker. You have to cast your phone screen in order to play your music on TV screen.Which brings a lot of problems. First you need a WiFi router with 2 GB data dedicated to this TV for casting only. Because it\\'s using Chromecast not miracast. So what happens is, you are sharing your mobile screen to your TV using mobile data even though it\\'s on same network. Which is stupid. Why in the world I have to spend my data to transfer the data packets using my router. It\\'s on same network for god\\'s sake.Also while casting if you open YouTube in your phone it opens YouTube app on tv, so you\\'ll end up spending 3X data for playing YouTube video. ( For playing in mobile, for transferring data to tv and for the video playing on TV). But fellow competitors like mi TV also have built in Chromecast only. I don\\'t know any budget TV which supports miracast, if you knew comment below to let me know.It can only access hard disc upto 2tb.Some apps like Udemy are not supported on this TV.You\\'re going to spend more money on ott, let me explain how.. if you\\'re going to use Netflix on TV you\\'ll need premium subscription to add 2-4 devices at a time. Also if you have Airtel xstreme on your phone, and thinking I can use Airtel xstreme on tv.. you\\'re wrong.. you need to purchase xstreme for TV as well.If you\\'re rich enough to purchase all ott platforms and have enough money to spend 4gb / day data on TV on regular basis, you\\'ll love this TV.Otherwise you\\'re gonna end up hating this TV and yourself for purchasing this TV.I chose to purchase this TV because it\\'s an Android TV, also home services during warranty period is free. I don\\'t have to take this TV to the service centre, if there\\'s something\\'s wrong. After warranty period they charge ₹450 for the service. Which is cheaper than other brand.But if I knew I\\'m gonna get this for ₹16k I wouldn\\'t even think about purchasing this TV. Because I got these picture and audio in my old Sansui LCD tv. Which lasted 5 years without any issues.,Excellent TV, picture quality superb-5*, for Sounds I will give 4*, for connectivity-5*. Overall excellent TV in low budget better than others Brands,Outstanding🤩🤩🤩I love it . Nuch better then MI led,Good in this price,Awesome product, superb audio n video,really experienced with 4k video n dolby audio.but Google chrome not installed in this,After using 43y1 for 1+ monthBought this OnePlus 43y1 android tv for a very cheap price, but the product isn\\'t upto oneplus standards.The picture quality is OK, and sometimes it gets flaky and dark for no reasons. Once i fiddle around with the picture settings this issue fixes, but it happens frequently. It\\'s like the tv is unable to remember the picture settings.Sound quality is also just about OK. There\\'s like literally no bass. Doesn\\'t matter how many different audio settings you try, the audio is weak. But, you could say, \"Itna paisa me itna-ich milega\".Important issues:The tv hangs, it just freezes, not very much, but once in every 3-4 days. Then you have to restart it from the main switch.Many times there\\'s no audio. Doesn\\'t matter which input you try. To fix this I have to restart the tv from the main switch.I sometimes connect bluetooth headphones to my tv. To connect it the first time, obviously, pairing is required. But, to connect it the second time, I have to unpair my headphones, and then again pair it. Otherwise the headphones won\\'t connect automatically. And there\\'s no option to search manually for previously connected devices. Every time I have to unpair and then pair the bluetooth device.The tv remote hangs too. Not all the times. Mostly it works very smooth, but sometimes it hangs. I think this issue is because sometimes the remote doesn\\'t get connected to tv via Bluetooth.Not to forget the tv doesn\\'t have a 3.5 mm jack.You cannot access tv settings while you are using any app. You will have to close the app and go to home screen to change audio/video settings, etc.Netflix only works in HD quality. There\\'s no FHD support for Netflix. I use 4k Netflix subscription, but on this tv it only works in HD.The Alexa support is still not available in the tv. I just cannot connect my Amazon Echo device to the tv. Tried everything, every steps i could find on the internet over several forums. At the end a OnePlus official answered my query on one of OnePlus official forums that the Alexa support will be made through an app, which will be released shortly. The app isn\\'t released till date.Overall, I five 3.5 stars to the tv. Just because of price and remote design. There\\'s nothing else special about the tv.,Disappointed with Oneplus, purchased Oneplus 43inch TV, stopped working within a month & even after complaining several time, there is no response.Edit : 25/02/2021Screen was replaced after 1 month of complaint in JanuarySoon after few weeks again the same issue has been started & now i make a complaint lets see when i will get a replacement.,This is a review post two months of usage. The TV on the hardware front is really good. But the software in the TV is really sad. There is a lot of time lag when you are casting to the TV. Sound goes immediately but the video lags by more than 10-20 seconds. The TV also keeps giving out a Google Assistant error message randomly. There were times when the audio error message was made in the middle of the night when the TV was switched off. Unless the software is upgraded or rectified, I wouldn\\'t recommend this TV. This review is coming from a person who is (was) a diehard fan of OnePlus. I have 3 mobile phones from OP in my home.,Plz improve courier speedPicture quality was best and nice biuld qualityBluetooth was not stableRemote was some times delay power on the TV time and some more improve TV quality and more,Nothing better than this in the market in this price range. Buy without any hesitation.Like a lot of other people I didn\\'t get the echo dot too, so a little sad about that.But TV is amazing,Oneplus connect app was good.Picture quality and sound quality are more than expected.Oneplus wont let you regret buying this quality producthappy buying and happy watching,i have done lot of research before purchase on the  basis of review and Youtube videos but does not helped in making any derision , rather i was confused between all Chinese brand .then made a purchase for Rs 11700 , including 10% HDFC card discount . watched 2-3 HD videos with 1080 PMy Opinion is belowBuy this TV if your budget is strictly constraint to  11-12k & you do not bother about Picture Quality .Don\\'t buy if you are used to watch Samsung , Sony TV , Full HD videos in mobile or have a full HD monitor .its quality does not matches Samsung Smart TV that is available for Rs16,000/-Returned TV back to amazon , now looking to buy a Samsung one .,Dont believe any false review and go for it, it is the best tv at this price.You cannot expect anything more at this price.,1.The product delivered on 12th July 2020 installation schedule on 20th July  delayed process in installation.2 . Picture quality is ok, sound quality is good for small room.3. Strong internet connection need for better performance otherwise  this tv is lagging.4. I face connectivity issues mobile phone is not connected easily, I have connected internet through mobile ( hot spot connetivity) some time I face hanging problem which I have power of once5. remote is not working properly.6.  I am very disappointed when my pendrive is not connected I never expected this issue in Oneplus brand7. I replaced this tv immediately after my installation process8. in this price segment this tv is good,Washed off picture quality as pixel density is less, sound is okay but Dolby features are gimmick.Should have been a 1080p display. No installation wall mount bracket with TV, need to purchase it seperately. It\\'s a made in India product and plastics, sockets and fit n finish is not as good as its Chinese counterparts like MI, VU and others.Worst installation service, after 16 days still no installation. Hence canceled the TV.MI TV offers better package for less 500 Rs. and better build quality.,I booked repair service by Oneplus care App .  No one come and update the status. too many time tried to contacting customer care of Oneplus. no acknowledgment. And tried booked by amazon warranty & services. No one come on appointment date they reschedule the appointment without contact me. this is very bad service.,Bhai log this is suvi, from Nagpur, Maharashtra,...Bro tv is all good no lags no nothing... Very good picture quality, good sound , and worth buying it if you are buying it for home use purposes.... All those glitches and lags are just because of wifi speed... In order to use this tv at high speed u must have high speed internet available or else for tv serial use it is all good go on with it ..,I have used mi and one plusPros1. Picture quality one plus is better2. Sound quality one is betterCons1. Lags heavily while changing ott and switch on / off. This too much annoying. Never expected this. Due to this sometime in the background last played will continue for few seconds. It spoiled entire mood and concept of good quality tv. Mi is much better there is not much lag.2. Remote design absolutely poor engineering remote design. It\\'s not handy to use, hold and stupid placement of keys in the remote made. Poor engineering design products. As compared mi is far better simple sleek and to the target.3. Time to switch on takes more than usual time.It\\'s honest review not filters,I purchased 43 inch tv and having best bezeless tv experience you will find in this price range. Premium built, video quality is simply awesome with Dolby audio.,Value for money💰!!!! Worth it!,I\\'ve got Internal Storage of 4GB and here is mentioned 8Gb of storage, can i know Why?,I bought this TV in April 2021 and it stopped working within a month. Okay that\\'s fine it can happen with any product right? It took almost 2 months to get a service guy, that\\'s also fine even though I had no entertainment at home because of the lockdown going on everywhere.All of sudden a service guy came like an angel and said I have to pay for the service as the board is burned it won\\'t comes under their warranty policy. Great!I have been using a VU tv for the past 4 years that too got damaged but replaced with a brand new TV twice without even any questions asked. It was my great mistake I thought OnePlus would provide Quality products and Quality services. They just su*k.,The TV is an okay-ish buy.Don\\'t come for the Brand here.I would happily suggest anyone to go with a Samsung or even Onida TV which does come at a nearby price point.The sound is low, but what to expect from a 20 Watt internal speaker.Even though it is back-lit with LED, there are certain points where you will not be able to see anything, it will be pitch black, while it should have been normal.And for the Game Mode, I used my PS4, XBOX ONE and Switch along with that. Played a couple of matches in Battlefield 1 and WWII. It reduces lag, but not upto a gaming level.The remote cannot start the tv all the time.It is slow when it comes to remote response, but that is only for the start up.But at this price point, what can one expect.And, at the time of writing this review, I had a serious issue a few days back, but the inputs from HDMI produced a grayscale output.I thought the TV was done for.But, it happens across all the OnePlus TV\\'s it seems.If anyone has the same issue, reset the entire TV.I wasted some time with Amazon and OnePlus Care by scheduling repair services.But it was no good.All in all, I love One Plus, despite the negative points stated, the above has 2 stars for Amazon and 1 for the TV.If you want to try this one, gladly you are welcome, but I would suggest you to try another brand, specifically well established ones like Samsung or Sony or TCL or Onida.,Picture quality not that much better but OK!  Sound quality is Good.,Gud display & audio output superb,Oneplus tv arrived my home todayIt very slim and price was also good. It was very slim and easy to handle.,I like one plus not china,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I bought this tv on October 2020 for 24,999/- 43 inch..It\\'s almost a year now I\\'m writing this review... Even after so many Negative Reviews....I placed order... On my own risk.... But ITS WORTH THE ORDER...Tv is Fine working well... As displayed... Ignore the negative reviews...Guy from Amazon mounted on wall ...wellGood sound quality... video quality.... Everything is good.,I\\'m really satisfied by 1 plus.Display quality is bestSound enough for a medium sized hallScreen mirroring works without laggingConsGoogle voice search delays by 4-5 seconds1plus connect isn\\'t so much interesting as it\\'s too much slowBluetooth we can\\'t connect our mobile but only tv with headset and Bluetooth speakerSo,don\\'t think of connecting mobile BluetoothOverallDisplay is awesomeSound quality niceBass average,I order the product on 28th july flash sale, it is worth for this price and good picture and sound quality,,Picture quality is amazing,I have been using the 43 inch Y Series for over a week now.Pros - love the black tones, the tv itself is very aesthetic, latest Android loaded, all frequently used apps/programs available in the tv, the remote is very sleek and is Bluetooth enabled, no need to point remote to tv, the delivery and installation services were very quick and efficient.Cons - the OS laga, the build quality does not feel great, plastic body, doesn\\'t work well with Alexa, sound quality is not great. The colours are not great either. Does not have different picture/colour modes. The biggest con for me is that it does not have adaptive display and gets too bright in low light while in standard settings.Overall - for the price of ₹22K - ₹23K the TV is totally worth buying. Remember that this is a budget tv. Premium TV\\'s are almost double the cost.,Value for money,Got it delivered on exact date and installation done next day. Loved the product better then mi and realme I guess.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Alright, here is the new One Plus TV 43Y. You can watch Unboxing on my you tube channel X:Plorer!.I have been using this tv since a week now.Here are some pros and cons of the tv,Pros: Price, yes being a Indian we always seek products which are best quality with affordable price, It fits well.#Gift: Yes, you get Alexa Dot with OnePlus 43Y and 55 U TVs. Who don\\'t like free stuff?#Picture Quality is super with baseless design of 88% of total view. Viewing angel will give you great experience.#Build Quality: I have been trying different TVs till now including Mi 55 inch, Iffalcon 43inch and other but trust me this One Plus is far ahead when it comes to design and quality material.Cons:#Sound: Yes it has 20wt output sound with Dolby Atmos but you won\\'t feel bass.#RAM: It has 1GB RAM with internal storage of 8GB out of which only around 4 GB is useful. This would make operation lit slow.#Andoid oxygen play: It\\'s hardly has watchable content and it\\'s too old as there is Patch wall.,Picture Quality & Sound Quality Is Up to Mark Blindly Go with it.,I have used it for only 1 day but my experience is awesome and I didn\\'t felt any laggy experience with the TV,Everything other than installation is remarkable,The TV\\'s voice assistant features are almost non-functional. Every time when I tried the voice command, the ongoing video/movie stuck. The picture and sound quality are not so great for a room of 100 sqft and there was a lot of glare even with less light in the room, tried all the suggestions on changing contrast/brightness etc., By looking at the hype, I expected a lot but this TV did not meet any of my expectations and left a disappointing experience.,too good!!!purchase without hasitation..only d problem is amazon late service n nothing else..,Love it ❤️,Amazing picture qualityDoesn\\'t lag, only lag found was during initial setup.20w Speaker with Dolby speakers does a great jobBezels are extremely less and gives a nice experience.OnePlus did a great job and does give a premium feel.Cons:Audio quality should be tweaked. No bass which is a huge disappointment.Alexa is not bundled, you need to add it separately during the purchase.@Amazon, when you mention that Alexa comes free with this purchase then make it bundled with the TV unit and do not ask Customers to add it separately during the purchase. Don\\'t expect the Customers to add it separately during the Flash sale. This is simply cheating on the Customers.,I don\\'t get the original bill with box. Kindly provide me a softcopy of my bill.,Sound quality is a bit poor remaining things are good,Delivery in time and  Installation was also in time overall good service,Apart from the screen size and the clarity and the sound ofcourse nothin in this is a Good buy..1)Technically challengedEvery time yo switch on the TV you need to have a separate network in which you connect it first then only you can connect it to your wifi.2) Pathetic Response timeIf incase you’re in a bad mood, then refrain from switching on this TV. Cuz it’s going to be like solving a puzzle what went wrong & what possibly can be right and after all of that the remote will give you a run which you never wanted.I can go on… but not worth my time.Just one thing if you think of buying CHEAP, you can opt for TCL instead but these are just junk covered with a shiny plastic and a good outlook.,It\\'s been 10 days I am using this TV... honestly the display quality is just amazing and the truly bezel less display looks incredible. However, I am disappointed with the sound quality it\\'s doesn\\'t sound good, I think becoz the speakers are down facing, but if u have a external speaker( which I have) thn it\\'s not the issue. Another problem is that TV is not that smooth and it lags a lot of times. Hopefully OnePlus will send will fix it with the update. Overall I am happy becoz sound issue is not a big deal as I use a speaker which everyone should, if you want to enjoy movies on prime and Netflix. Lagging issue will b fixed becoz I trust OnePlus, as thr Service is really good. Overall it\\'s not a bad deal seeing the amazing display and stylish looking frame.,Remote connectivity is weak,Writing this feedback as the TV does not startup using one click on the remote (power button), i have to keep on clicking for many times till it starts up...(happens all time)I ensured that there is no obstacle between remote and the tvSecondly, i did connect 2.1 sound using Bluetooth device, after 2-3 days of use i either have to clear cache memory for Bluetooth system or cut off the power completely and restart to use the sound via BluetoothOverall experience of buying this TV was really not good i would say, customer support does not answer your query accurately, showroom guys wants to route to customer care for anything issues.I bought an another TV from MI and it has been used since last 1.5yrs I would really recommend everyone to go for MI (no issues till date) instead this one,If you are looking for budget tv go for it , regarding sound issueif you use hdmi cable you will get Dolby Atmos audio which is very low as sound will be disturbed evenly with surrounding. but if you use the old regular analogue 3 pin adapter probes ( 3 coloroued pins for sound video used for DVD players ) you will get better loud sound so goodenough .The conclusion is if you want huge sounds go for probes you will get so high volume even when you put tv output volume to 2 or 3 but if you want Dolby clarity sound but less volume output go for hdmi cable it will be clear but low,The picture quality is very bad even at 1080 resolution the images are very blurry and one can see lots of pixels.  The colors r too bright and most of the things are seen as white spots instead of light yellow or blueLooks like the are capturing and sending the data to Chinese serversI have MITV4 and it has much better quality and color output and sound quality alsoColor seems to be over saturatedthe home screen is traditional android which is quite boring and does not gives u that rich feel same thing with remote, which is quite of plastic and on press of single button it take 2 to 3 clicks emote very uneasy and buttons placed illogicalOn poweroff TV does not switch off, its just turn itself mute and screen off, thus keep burning ur power even when in sleep modeNo audio point to connect to home theater or external entityits gives the feel of low cost quality and audio as one gets in 1/2 start hotelsAvoid, do not go with just name, its not worth,,The TV stopped working after 3 months. I have registered a complaint about amazon and OnePlus. No one has called or came to me for servicing the product. How come you close the issue by your self this is totally unexpected and unacceptable from your side. It is very shameful on part of you, simply bluffing the customer. Even after repeated complaints to the OnePlus and Amazon, no action has been taken. It is very shameful to both Amazon and OnePlus for their services,Screen casting not working,The product is worth its price. Let me highlight certain pointspros-1. Display- the display is brilliant ,specially the black color gamut is awesome2.Smart features- good smart features,easy to download contents3.Design- Bezel less design gives an appealing lookcons-1. Although the product has Dolby Digital surround sound but still it feels a bit low output in terms of voice2. The operating remote feels a lag when you switch on the T.V.3. No button features due to which the T.V. is solely dependent on the remote and once u get any issues with the remote you\\'re in trouble.4.Installation- its been a Month since this product was delivered but still installation has not been arranged by amazon, secondly the delivery guy was very rude,did not deliver the product at home had to go almost a mile to receive my product. my request to all please ensure your installation else you would be left in oblivion like me.,The almost bezel less display feels good on wall,I am writing this review after using the tv for more than 2 monthsPros-Picture and sound quality is goodNice and handy remoteCons-*Says Alexa supports this product but it only supports volume, turn off tv, change input*Hangs once or twice in a day which is very bad, didn\\'t expect this from one plus*When viewed from side picture becomes more white. Visibility is not good from side angles*When try to switch on tv you have to be within one meter for remote to work else tv will not switch on, this is worst,Actually I went through all the comments and reviews, I was initially intersted in OnePlus but  after reading these reviews I got confused. Then I checked for other smart TVs and finally settled to purchase this OnePlus TV only because of the trust and experience I had on OnePlus products mainly mobile phones which me and my family are using.Believe me after receiving this TV I couldn\\'t understand why people are so critical about this !! It serves all the purpose very well.. all smart features are excellent, connectivity is so good.. picture quality and sound is absolutely fine and sufficient for me. People complaint about its picture & sound quality but I found it amazing.. I don\\'t expect any better clarity of picture than this TV.. and sound.. I couldn\\'t use it on more than 10% volume in my 100 sq ft room. Guys It\\'s just a TV, it could be bad, good or excellent.. for me it\\'s Excellent.. I am not looking for a wife here.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣And people who are being so critical about this TV, I don\\'t know what are they were expecting.. may be they are comparing this TV with a PVR screen, or its sound with a bose music system then definitely it\\'s a below expectation product for you, sorry for your loss.,Value for money,Worst service ever.... It\\'s just been 23 days tht we bought it. It was all working fine and all of a sudden it shut down and we were unable to switch it on that too no body touched it or did anything.. How can this happen??? Quite surprised. .  I\\'d tried calling oneplus customer care, they\\'re saying they won\\'t be able to replace it since we\\'d purchased it from amazon..  And this seems to be too hectic to hear...  What\\'s this amazon..  Never expected this... The quality of the service is pathetic..  Please don\\'t buy it from amazon for their eye catching offers.  It always good to go n buy from their own website( I feel so)... If I would have done that then I would have got a replacement atleast.....,I never expected from OnePlus,TV experience is with pictures quality and sound along with smart features1) picture quality - very poor2) sounds is okay but don\\'t bother as I have sound bar3) TV takes 15~20 sec to start.4) slow in operation like going back to previous series or jumping to other plateform.Slim and Very light weight but how does it matter as It will be hand on the wall.Final comments - Dont buy or at least see few videos in youtube before buying for experts comments.I was blind with OnePlus name and  mobile fan for past several years and now I will be sorry\\'for very long time.,Picture quality and sound quality is excellent,Biggest disappointment with this TV was that this TV doesn’t support 5ghz wifi bandwidth, it still supports the 2.4ghz. Which I realised after everything was setup.Overall the TV is good, picture quality is good not great but assuming the TV is for only Rs. 24000 I wasn’t expecting much.Sound again isn’t top notch but loud enough. You will have to customise the sound settings a bit or if you really want that sround sound kinda effect you may need to buy an additional sound bar.The remote connection is good, and everything else is fine.,Begel less is awesomeThat is a good in one plusGreater better,Oneplus is worth the money as always!,This TV at that Price Tag is really a competitor to many other brands.The Best points from this TV include- Smart Features- Minimal Bezel frame picture- Google Voice Assistant- Customer friendly settingsOne thing I wasn\\'t accepting from this is its sound. I used a Samsung Smart TV before this and its output itself sounded as if it was from a home theatre but the same output from Oneplus was pathetic. I even tried all their settings and features available. I then ordered a JBL Infinity home theatre only for the sound thing and then connected it over Bluetooth. It was then beautiful and perfect. But after a couple of days there was a lag between the TV sound output and that from the Home theatre. I then replaced the JBL thing from Amazon and to my surprise found out that even the next one had a similar issue after a couple of days.I\\'m still worried if the Bluetooth feature of Oneplus TV has an issue or just my specific piece. This review of mine doesn\\'t judge Oneplus TV at any side. It\\'s just my experience. Other than the Bluetooth lag at some times, everything is at it\\'s best and you can go for it without a second thought.,Having dark patches at the bottom edge of the screen. Asked for the replacement. Not the way, it was expected. Disappointed...Edit: After a week or so, got the tv replaced. This one piece is OK and thanks to the tech team listening and addressed the issue as early as possible.Still I have some issue, why the bluetooth once paired (for speaker) doesn\\'t stay forever? Every time, I had to unpair and pair the bluetooth after switching off and on the tv. It\\'s so irritating 😡😡😡😡😡Rest I\\'m ok with the it.😓😓,This has some issues! It was slow since the day I bought it.  I had read that  this is the way it is designed it is a slow tv.  Fine by me I bought it like a dumb a.. now after few months it stucks! Manufacturing defects were never considered and repaired before a launch! Go for it on your own risk.Ps:- risking isn\\'t worth on this one..Go sky diving If you wanna risk so much. 😂,Overall meets the expectations at this price,Good for the price you pay. Software is buggy but nothing\\'s deal breaking here.Picture Quality: Its Decent. Slim bezels. You\\'ll find backlit led bleeding in on the side. Overall it\\'s a good quality (for what you pay)Audio: Its hard to hear dialogues in the movies. Ull be needing a decent external speakers for sure.,The TV looks really good with thin bezels.,this TV has some serious software issue, until or unless they rectify the issue i would not recommend this TV. but yah i hope it can be resolved by a software update (takes time more than 5 month i guess).Software issues:1. when unboxed it was fine after some days, the software is getting lag .2. the screen is getting Fully RED sometimes (like the display has damaged), but after restart or re-set the TV, it is  getting normalized.* Picture Quality is not too awesome but yah if you could adjust the Picture settings its nice(but not awesome)Good aspects:1. the Remote is awesome , if you connect it with bluetooth its damn good. if it\\'s not its bit laggy.2. if you are watching the cable/dish, you don\\'t need to change the input always (to HDMI/composite) it will read  the last input when you switch back on.3. oneplus connect is working fine , but yah its laggy, you can change the below steps  #movements (left right up down and select)  #change the inputs (hdmi composite..)  #back button4. google voice is working fine (can open the apps .. download.. etc...)5. the TV sound is great not a dolby one but yah its good.Bad aspects :1. not able to connect with Alexa(Echo Dot 3rd gen) i have checked with the service team they told its might be a  software issue. and they also told they will sent a guy to resolve this (*technichal guy is not yet came)2. some time the screen is getting Fully Red, got resolved after re-setting , its irritating sometimes to re-set the  TV again and again.3. while purchasing the TV, the Alexa(Echo dot 3rd gen its not free, i have checked with the Amazon, they told its  not free anymore)4. wall mount is not with the TV. we have to purchase it from the Amazon technical guy and cost is around 1500/-  (better to purchase it separately )* there is 2 aspects to start TV.1. when unplugged and re-plug it its taking  around 30 sec to completely start the TV2. plugged and switch off from remote and switch on from the remote again, its taking around 10 secconclusion:wont recommend to purchase now, might be after resolving it by an software update (might be take some month i guess)after 3 months of usage:1.TV is getting stuck sometimes, need to unplug and replug to start working again2.sometimes composite mode is not working (only shows blue background for 10 sec and comes back to home page),Hi team,I bought this tv around 2months back and getting wifi issue and remote control problem from day and open a case with support team, its been a 2 month till now no resolution.Chasing care from oneplus care app, Twitter, whatsApp, mail support but no resolution. I don\\'t know when can I get resolution. After 10months my warranty period will be over, I dnt have hopes.Please think before you buy.This is my personal experience. Iam not enforcing anyone.This is after 90days , I opened a ticket 2months back but till now there is no resolution. Customer care guys just closing the ticket and asking feedback, there main focus is on feedback not on resolution.Other side I escalated to Amazon still there is no resolution.  I don\\'t know when I can get resolution,I bought this TV from Amazon. After 6 months, one fine day, I couldn\\'t turn on the TV. Since I have paid for extra warranty, I contacted Amazon for technical support. I scheduled the appointment 4 times. Every time the technician didn\\'t turn up and they reschedule it. I was contacting OnePlus as well, nobody visited or tried to resolve the issue, and keep on sending automated replies. Now it\\'s been nearly 4 months and still its not resolved.,I have bought this TV in August 2020. I have started facing lag, glitches, screen freeze since Feb 2021. Since then it\\'s been 20-30 calls to customer care , 10 service schedules and on hold status. You will not get any help from Amazon or Qdigi (one plus partner). It\\'s a bad launch. I can\\'t describe the months of harassment by Amazon and One plus to finally telling me that My warranty is over now in August and no further help can be done without actually resolving anything.,First I received this product with a different stand and they send a replacement for this. All this process took around 1 month. Finally, I got a working product.After using it for 6 months, we were watching the TV suddenly it stopped working. I raised a complaint immediately. I waited for few days and started calling customer care. Every day, the phone will be attending by different executives they will tell theirs on stories. It will be assigned to Technician or the call with escalated to you will get a call back so and so... After a month and half the complaint got assigned to a technician and without visiting the site they told they have ordered for parts.During all this time, we were using our old TV. Good that we haven\\'t sold.At last, they came the home with a TV and exchanged some parts with our TV. The TV is working.. but one issue. The TV display is coming opposite side. If we rotate the TV only we will be able to see. Now they told me there are no settings in the remote to change the direction. They will come with software to resolve this issue.  Again the service person came and tried to fix it but still, it\\'s not resolved.Now they want to take the TV to service place and we have to get it from there. Not sure how much time it will take.This is my experience with the OnePlus TV. I would suggest don\\'t go for this product.. If you still want to buy then arrange an alternative and be ready.,I think that I should have bought Mi 4X instead of this but the 43inch of Mi 4X was not available on Amazon and I don\\'t like to buy from Flipkart!1) This OnePlus TV has lot of lag issues, since it has only 1gb of ram the optimization is poor2) the sound is not good at all, for a room it is okay but after 50% volume, don\\'t know if volume even increases, instead the effect increases which compromises the quality of sound. I recommend buying a soundbar3) does not power on by single click from remote. Some issue with that4) doesn\\'t have new features like multicast,Only buy it if you\\'re a OnePlus fan, otherwise Go for Mi 4X instead, that provides 4K and better optimized performance,Low quality product, bought in first sale. Sound quality is so poor. Returned after few days.,:: Honest review Let me write one by one ::  (Review after 2 weeks)  First of all I have pre-booked Oneplus Y43 and availed the acko’s 2 years extended warranty,And  also Amazon ECHO DOT along with this TVWhich is worth to buy at 23K..!! (Those who have missed Echo Dot, I feel very sorry for them)Also Alexa worked me as a smart connector between TV and my Sony home theatre system, without any digital cables or converters ..! Saved my money there too..!!1. Picture Quality : Is pretty good and 1080i LED display. Viewing angle should be straight and if it’s more than 30degree picture clarity will reduce and colours starts fading. Make sure you are straight infront of TV view.2. Sound Quality : is ok kind of Quality at this price as I am depending more on home theatre speakers, thus it’s good for me.3. Value for money : yes definitely you can choose at this budget unless like other brands of this range and it’s 43”.5.chromecasting is built-in, can avail from IOs platform too as I am using it..!4. Includes all the modern smart tv features like Netflix, amazon,YouTube and google assistants in one single button. But some time-lag can be experienced while changing the input sources.Even google assistance is bit slow to catch-up when compared to Alexa..!Overall I can give  ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️Thanks Team Oneplus and Amazon.in,Pros:Contrast Ratio is Amazing.Black level is amazing.Viewing angles are fine.Awesome Color accuracy.Latest Android version.Cons:Poor quality Speakers.Little bit lag, probably the OS.As for speakers, why would you use inbuilt speakers?What matters most is Contrast Ratio, Color range, viewing angles, and clarity.Bit Over PricingAMAZON INSTALLATION:Installation has not completed, Waited for 28 days, Then done with local technician.Amazon Service is getting poorer.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Google assistant is not working properly 😒,Smartest smart tv from oneplus..in this price range no other TV\\'s has such picture quality and features..its totally premium product..just one thing pls buy soundbar or any sound system with this..this tv has dolby digital, dolby digital plus, surround sound...which are awesome functions indeed but u can feel these features only if u have external sound system . Else the speakers of 10w each are very low in volume..a good movie with sound effects cant be enjoyed at all..else this tv is highly recommended. All the features works perfectly as the company says in ads. Value for money indeed.One update after using the tv for 1.5 month-1. Never faced problems like auto restart, lags, etc. But yes if u install loads of apps then u should wait few seconds when u start the tv else u will see lil lags..but after few seconds it will run smoothly..,TV works fine. Features are also impressive. But the rigidity of the TV is questionable.Installation Service by One Plus was very poor. The installation was scheduled between 2-6pm and they reached around 6.30pm and left around 8.45pm. The Fixed wall mount used was in rusted condition. And they drilled total 5 holes on the TV Mounting board for 4 screw!! and the Wooden board got damaged. The TV was tilted to one side after installation and then they had to use small paper pieces to level the TV ! For the fixed TV mount the charge was rs 500 even though the charge written in amazon is rs 299 for a 43\" TV!!,By comparing with my friend MI TV, oneplus is very bad. The picture quality and sound quality is very poor comparing with his TV. The remote control and voice recognition is perfect. But the clarity of display is very bad according to MI TV. Till the reviewing date there is no inbuilt apps for screen casting,etc. We should seperatly want to download Airscreen app from play store. For installing other apps this TV not have file manager to download apk from USB, we should also want to download that from play store. I am damn sure that My friends MI TV is better than oneplus TV. My rating to this TV is 2.5/5.Not worth this TV for 12,999.better go for MI tv or other brands like tcl, realme, etc. I think that Oneplus will overall these products, but in case of TV till I am putting the review MI TV is good by comparing with my friends TV.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0This review is in usage of 9 months. Worst product from OnePlus. I just don\\'t even understand why they had to come into TV. My personal opinion always go with Sony or LG. It is the best.2nd time issue with the display.First issue arrived after 4 months I bought the TV. Same as you see in the picture. (This image is second time issue)But it was working for 30 mins and it started to fade away. I usually don\\'t use the TV much so I didn\\'t care about it for 2 months. Then it started to fade forever. So had to book a service. Nonsense in this pandemic. It took 2 months to fix.Fine atleast some picture to see in the second lockdown after the service. And it didn\\'t like to work after 1 month after the 1st service. Same kind of issue. This image is reference after 1st service done to display. (Changing the whole display).I personally recommend Sony of LG. They are best in TVs. Ofcourse they are high priced for what reason you guys might think. This is the reason.These guys, I just don\\'t understand why did I even step foot in these kinds of company\\'s for a different product. They are utter waste of time and money. I have used the TV only for 6 months. That\\'s it.And I\\'m in second services with one year.Bullshit what others think about this TV or the brand. Shame to say I\\'m oneplus user for 7 years now.Cheap quality displays they use. So is the lowest price.,Amazing product got it for 12k. A ton of features added .,Pixel quality is ok. You can easily notice it with different colours. Using android enabled smart tv hence have same emotions like the way android works or probably the function processing capability of the tv is not at par. Tv Remote sensor works only in you are in range of 2 metres irrespective of inserting battery cells. I feel my Tata sky remote sensor was out of the world since it use to capture signals from any corner of the room where my old tv was installed.Piece of advise if you money to spend go for another brand or device altogether and you limited on budget I would recommend you to with this tv,Writing this review after 5 days of usage:-Picture quality was excellent for the priceSound was decent dont expect more, better to go with a 2.1 home theatreSome lags in software hope these will be resolved soon by ota updateNice design and bezelless display is top notchInternet and dth connectivity is goodOne con is that it donot have 3.5mm jack i bought optical converter separatelyBluetooth remote was sleek and niceDont bother fake reviews and just go for itGood product from oneplus....!  Loved it♥️,Simply amazing picture quality and sound,Awesome products,Display quality superSound quality ok,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Very nice 👌👌👌😊😊😊 products. One plus,Im impressed very reasonable rate and remote control is through blutooth. Killer tv at the 12998 😁🙈,The product itself is great value for money for less than 25k for a 43 inch Android LED TV. Overall picture quality is great at normal viewing angles but the colours shift slightly at extreme wide viewing angles. But it will be good enough in most situations.There are lot of picture and sound settings, it also supports Dolby. You can easily connect your Bluetooth headset or soundbar. Sound quality lacks bass and punch, it\\'s not great for movies or songs, but enough for usual News and Sports. For movies I suggest to use dedicated soundbar or home theatre. Remote control has only Bluetooth functionality. No infrared, so battery drain might be faster. Sometimes TV lags to recognize remote operation.TV stand is plastic and feels kinda weak. It wobbles a bit when you nudge the screen. There is no AUX output. Only optical for audio out. Apparently HDMI ARC is there. But haven\\'t tried it.WiFi connectivity is good and fast, though it connects only to 2.4GHz bands. TV has only 1GB RAM so it tends to lag a bit while running more than 2 apps in background. But it\\'s acceptable in normal circumstances. There seems to be no surge protection so better to connect it to a stabilizer if your electricity fluctuates often.USB pen drives can be connected and we can also choose different audio languages in the movie files if available, which is great.It\\'s a great TV for the price. More worth than Sony or LG which are well above 35k for Android models of same size. I think it has a better display than MI TV, Panasonic or Realme TV.,I used this for more than 8 months, finally put the tv for exchange when it was still under warranty, couldn\\'t tolerate the awfulness anymore.  It was very slow even when there are only 5 apps installed, I literally have to wait for nearly a minute to switch to another app and play a movie, Sound Quality was very poor, if there\\'s some bass in any scene that am watching there is an irritating static noise. Big mistake to have bought this seeing one plus brand name. Mi has better tv in the same price range. Don\\'t think there will be negative reviews for all the brands and avoid what am writing, am serious and writing this out of frustration, please avoid this tv.,good,The TV display dint start after using 2 weeks no idea to the service agent what the problem is .Service agent says you will have issue resolved in a week, mail by digicare comes saying issue not in scope of warranty.What is the problem ? Just 25 days and this is the condition of tv, regretting myself buying it on first sale should have gone for mi or samsungPlease look into this Amazon and OnePlus .,I am quite Happy with the product... Weightless TV..Great job by One Plus,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0It\\'s hardly one month and the TV is unusable. Volume keeps increasing and screen flickers to the bottom.Cannot control the TV through remote.  Reached out to customer care and the response very slow.Update 6/sep.Customer care replaced the remote and it did not solve the issue.More than a month that I raised a complaint and the problem still exists.PATHETIC SUPPORT.Amazon just keeps escalating the issue without resolution.,Awesome tv,Avoid buying this tv. It\\'s seems cheap but so is the performance. I bought this tv one week back and in this one week I have faced the following problems on:- tv has hung/frozen four times- audio was on but video was completely blanked out once- lag when bluetooth headphone is connected and the audio breaks- replacement cannot be done until service centre guy checks it- service centre person never turns up despite multiple follow-ups. Raised the issue with Amazon on 27th and still waiting for some service centre person to pick my call and attend to the problemDissapointing,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Very good TV,Excellent picture quality. Perfect for a common man\\'s middle class family.,Perfect as per expectations..,Never thought I will have to write a negative feedback for OnePlus products.We insisted our parents to buy this TV and we are regretting it.The TV constantly hangs and everytime we ask for a return or for replacement of the product, a technician is been appointed to check the TV.I really don\\'t know how to sync the timing of technician and the time when TV hangs to be at the same time...Really disappointed by the product and also by Amazon because I still don\\'t have any clarity whether or not there is going to be replacement or refund or not...Requesting Amazon to kindly provide the relevant information and solve the grevieneces of geneiue customers.Note I have called Amazon customer service for atleast 3 timesAwaiting a positive response from Amazon,I installation not done properly , I have registered my complaintSound is not great, buy vu cinema tv for good soundPicture quality is goodUI is goodRemote is good clutter free ,simple , cute .After using for one month now there is display issues ..I am really not happy with oneplus purchase,Lags a lot, Sony home theatre connected to the TV worked fine for the first month but post some software update started to face too many issues, home theatre not getting recognised, remote issue the one plus customer service is very bad they take weeks to respond. They are yet to come and check what the issue is.Bought the TV on the first day it was launched but regrett now very upsetting experience.,Worth the money and the quality is splendid!,Awesome,The remote stopped working it isnt damaged by any means I don\\'t know now how to use the TV as nothing can work without remote so useless product as expected from China 😡,There is a lot of lag while operating the tv with remote. To switch on the tv, I need to try Atleast 10 times. And if it still does not work, I need to manually switch on the tv by pressing the button behind TV. I really like the One Plus brand but, TV definitely is not up to the mark. Can\\'t handle the lag sometimes. It\\'s very frustrating after paying so much money and can\\'t do anything when the remote does not work. I\\'m sure I definitely can use connect feature on my One Plus mobile phone as remote, but what\\'s the TV remote for when it does not do what it is supposed to do.,Giving review after 1 month of usage. One of the worst TV\\'s I have ever seen. Avg display, Avg sound. Doesn\\'t switch on as soon as I power on from the remote, need to press at least 2-3 times to switch on TV.  There\\'s a lot of lag for volume buttons. Sometimes TV itself goes to home page from live TV and doesn\\'t go back to live TV, need to switch off TV and switch it on again. After 1 month of usage TV hanged up a few times. The TV even doesn\\'t connect to OnePlus connect app. Need to find TV on mobileapp for so much time, sometimes even after many trails I can\\'t connect to my TV. Even opening and closing apps is very laaagggggyyyyy.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Very nice 👍👌👍👌👍,I bought this TV based on my experience with One plus Phone. Contrary to the quality of the phones, the TV quailty has proven to be nightmare for me. On top of that their service is poor. The option to register complaint through Amazon gives no result. 1st the display was not proper, after complaining they took two months to change the display. The new display lasted only 10 days and now its completely black screen with few colored lines. Its been 10 days, I have raised complaint to both Amazon and One plus directly but all in vain. I will not recommended this TV to anyone. I have two more TVs at my home (both Samsung), never faced any such issue. Samsung has the same price and same features. I wish I can replace it for Samsung.....and now its the third time that the TV is down, 3rd time in warranty period,Just today the installation guy came and install the tv perfectly1st glanaceThis is almost an bezel less tv I cannot expect much in this price but the design is quite stylishSecondly it took some time for start at first timeBut then after it is smooth.2nd galanceAfter completed all the setups on tv for its specs 1gb ram it is super smooth no doubt there is an delay of 3 to 4 seconds but that ok as tv used frequently then that delays also minimises3rd glanaceThe sound is grt for this price point. it\\'s not that you purchase a tv under 23k and ten compared it with 50k tv that\\'s unfair but the tv comes with Dolby atoms + and Dolby Atmos both features for sound4th finaleLastly Google assistant works pretty well with this tv too it response time is in milliseconds,Impressed with the product quality and design, performance is also decent, video quality is quiet good, audio not up to the expectations, terrible installation service, technician never contacted even after 14 days from the delivery date, contacted amazon many times, had to reschedule 3 times, canceled the service at last.,Like the title of my review said, I am going to only list down the factual pros and cons after a day of using the TV elaborately and let you decide for yourself.Pros-Great picture quality, especially if content is in HD-The smart TV features that allows you to pair it with your phone, laptop, bluetooth speakers, bluetooth headphones, etc. are super handy-The screen size of 43\" is just perfect for your room unless it is ultra spaciousCons-The sound. 20W is loud enough, but the quality is really poor and one-dimensional so you will surely need an external sound system or sowaker-The finishing of the product is not the best. One can tell how OnePlus managed to price this at 25k when you pay attention to how they\\'ve cut corners on the quality. The OnePlus logo on the front is titled (first time I\\'ve ever seen this on a product from a reputed brand). There\\'s a considerable gap between the display and top corner bezels, and the plastic finishing isn\\'t even-There\\'s a lag when you\\'re operating the TV (switching between apps, browsing content, and giving Google assistant voice commands) 50% of the time. Hoping OnePlus fixes it with future software updates but so far there\\'s no official word on thatThose are my pros and cons in a nutshell, now the decision is yours,Hello,Please do not buy TV from online...because I bought one plus TV on June 20th, within 2 months display went off..after that I am trying  for warranty claim...but it\\'s been 10 days still no one from Amazon responding properly...I don\\'t know when issue will be resolved...so better go to local vendor and buy electronic items..atleast we can ask that guy if any problem occurs ...,I like vry much,I bought this TV in pre booking. The TV quality is adequate, there is nothing good about it.After 6 months my TV face an issue where HDMI ports were non-functional, it has been 30 days yet, I complained both Amazon and OnePlus for the warranty but both are unable to repair it because of scarcity of parts.OnePlus is not the same brand it used to be, the products are pathetic and sub standard.,Nice TV,As far as display and sound is concerned, the tv is a good buy.But the tv lags very much. The processor isn\\'t that powerful. I don\\'t know how at the launch time the demos work so fine.Navigating between sources,apps, volume control is very laggy.Switching tv on is very tricky. Sometimes it takes 10+ button clicks to turn on tv.This issue is same with Mi TVs as well.,The output of video quality is really good.But, the TV lags very oftenly.Major manufacturing problem in all y series 43inch television is with HDMI port 2. The screen keeps flickering or goes blank for 2-3seconds if connected to HDMI2. Tried with different devices in HDMI2 port to confirm the issue.I got the TV replaced. But the same error again persists even with the replacement TV.Hence, it\\'s confirmed that there is some manufacturing deffect with this model of television.,Great product.,Value for money, go for it,Reviewing after using the product for a month.*Picture quality is awesome. It will beat many other competitors in this price range but not that great as boasted in the launch event.*Sound Quality is average. But you have to make some changes in the settings to get a good sound output. But compared to Motorola and realme tv in this price range, it\\'ll lose. In this TV to get a good sound output, you have to max the volume.*Software is the point where I got disappointed from one plus. I expected many things because it\\'s a TV from Oneplus. The TV lags a little bit. Control from the TV remote takes 1-2 seconds for the TV to operate. I hope one plus gives a good proper update to clear this problem.*Ram is 1gb and the storage is 8gb out of which the available is 3.6gb. Motorola has 4.6gb of free space. So a little disappointment but it\\'s a TV after all not a smartphone.* Input ports works fine and u won\\'t get a 3.5mm port.*Opening an app takes some time which is a little irritating.*As said about the Oneplus connect app, it\\'s not that hype what you saw during the launch event. One annoying thing is you have to open a oneplus connect app from the TV and then you can use it from your smartphone. Typing option is not available.* Sometimes the TV doesn\\'t open YouTube. Have to restart the TV and then open YouTube.If Oneplus is seeing this Review I expect you to solve the software issue regarding the lag which annoys a lotOne more thing I couldn\\'t connect Alexa to this TV.Also I couldn\\'t connect Google remote.Overall it\\'s a good budget TV. But it\\'s not that buttery smooth. If the software issue is solved then this TV will be a great budget TV.I hope my review helps you.,Amazing,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0पिक्चर क्वालिटी शानदार हैं, साउंड बहुत ही शानदार हैं,टाटा स्काई hd वाला लगाइये बेहतरीन क्वालिटी हैं, यू ट्यूब अन्य एंड्राइड एप्प बहुत अच्छे से चलते हैं आप इसे आराम से. ले सकते हैं मुझे तो बहुत पसंद आया मै बहुत सारे टीवी देखने के बाद इसको चयन किया, और मुझे खुशी हुई की ये एंड्राइड टीवी लिया जो बहुत ही शानदार हैं, अमेज़ॉन अपने ग्राहकों को कभी निराश नहीं करता, धन्यवाद अमेज़ॉन,Best Quality product at a cheap price,Amazing as it should be.,Nice tv under 13k,Got a faulty remote straight out of the box, with neither OnePlus nor Amazon taking responsibility and both asking me to approach the other. As a manufacturer, OnePlus should ideally honour warranty replacements especially when the product is less than 24 hours old and faulty right out. If you\\'re buying this, be warned that OnePlus support is super apathetic and you\\'ll probably be left fending for yourself.TV is fine(ish) as a product, nothing exceptional. It\\'s rife with software bugs and lags -- can\\'t even download apps because they all get stuck on \"pending\". Go for an Amazon FireTV, a non-smart TV with a fire stick, an Apple TV, or just assemble one yourself - you\\'ll have a better experience than with this garbage product and company.,👍🏼,This has been one hell of a let down - it isnt a bad TV but something about it that leaves me disappointed. I have had many TVs, Sony, LG, Mi, Vu - they have all add something to vow. This one comes out as very ordinary. But if you are burying it, its not the TV that will bother you - its the service. Its been 2 weeks since I raised a complaint, they have done nothing about it. Tweeting, calling, mailing - nothing has worked!! So my advise - look for someone who respects your business.,Excellent,The tv i bought is not worth.Its too damn slow. It starts and switches off on own.Installation was not proper may be.Even after resetting everything the tv works on its own n is very damn slow.Voice commands does not work.,Review after a week:Pros:1. Less Bezel, not Bezel less.2. Screen quality is okay for the price range.Cons:1. Muffled audio. No bass. Not even B of Bass.2. Software glitches. Remote response time is slow.3. Color reproduction not accurate.4. No IR for remote.5. Cheap material.A mediocre at best product from OnePlus.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Very worst company and very bad customer support....I have purchased this one plus 32y tv on 8 july20 and tv display has gone on 16 Aug 20....I have complained and talk to many times to amazon and one plus care they only send technicians for visit...I m writing this review after 10 days from complaint date and still they are saying that due to unavailable of parts i am not able to repair your tv....they are just making fool to Indian user....pls don\\'t buy and don\\'t suggest to any one....,The Product came faulty out of the box. Within two months of purchase there were visible lines and blacked out picture when connected to a set top box.So finally one day the product decided to quit with no picture but just RGB lines on display. See for the details in shared pic.Now coming to the service part. It\\'s been almost 3months since I am trying to get it serviced or repaired by Amazon(product support agency). Well it is a new year now still no luck.The customer care executives are a bunch of fools with no remors of your problem. Their constant jab is wait for 48hrs problem will be resolved. They provide you with all sorts of misinformation regarding their product support. One told me it will be fulfilled by ONEPLUS,Honestly oneplus don\\'t give a flying duck\\' about customer or later in product support. With multiple calls and false promises, I called back Amazon Cs, this is when I came to know the product and service will be done by Amazon. Anyway after multiple calls and escalations till date no one visited. An engineer was scheduled to visit while he didn\\'t and contacted me via call and asked me to click picture of the problem and send me via whatsapp. After looking upon it he told me it\\'s a manufacturing defect and will be replaced at the earliest. Well later received a mail from Amazon stating support has been cancelled.So the moral of the story is,THE STRUGGLE IS REAL.Purchase One plus at your own risk.Don\\'t trust Amazon for any service related query.,Very good picture quality enjoying watching movies. Sound quality require some improvement. Easy to connect with app. Very good installation service.Lots of one start in review are due to not getting Alexa offer and faulty products and installation service.Regarding Alexa they mentioned it\\'s free or on less price but as there routine offer it\\'s not kept easily available u have to check and add offer in u r cart which is not expected from amazon. It heart\\'s if you buy product and not got offered Alexa. So my sincere request to amazon if u are willing to give any offer keep it easy and don\\'t hide it. Else didn\\'t give what we are getting in this price One ➕ Tv we are happy.Thanks,Worst tv experience that I have ever had , in my life with this TV, worst customer service experience and service .Amazon kept the promise of contacting the manufacturer , which was to harsh for a month old TV, TV had bad screen issue remote issue .waiting for the drama to get over from the one plus side,1. Screen Flickering is the most common problem2. Half of the times, TV doesn\\'t start with a single button press by the remote.3. Booting takes at-least 30 seconds4. Screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time.5. System lag is the maximum in this class of TV\\'s.6. Most of the Apps doesn\\'t work which is downloaded from playstore.7. Youtube Apps crashes many times.8. Airtel Extreme doesn\\'t work.9 Picture quality doesn\\'t beyond 1080p, even if play the 4K video.Overall the bad experience which is never expected from the brand like OnePlus.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Don\\'t buy OnePlus TV I Bought OnePlus y series 43 in\" tv with in one and half month tv screen problem, I search technician In chennai , vellore, and kanchipuramNot available in 3 district , then I realised total tamilnadu technician not availableLocal service man told that you complaint register to  customer care then he will guide you like that,My first complaint registered  sep18th 2021Still 7 to 8 times following for recovery of complaintBut more than 2 month completed still my tv problem not solvedSo don\\'t buy OnePlus tv,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I bought OnePlus 32 Y series smart TV on 16 Sep 2020 and during the initial usage I felt like this was the best grab for the price because Oneplus gives its superior build quality and smart features and everything seems to be fine for first 2 months.Literally everything was good .But after two months of usage the TV suddenly started showing display issues , such as change in colour , flickering etc and this issue disappears when the TV is  RESTARTED . Again this issue started appearing on random basis and goes when restarted.So when this happened multiple times I myself recorded a video and pictures  of the same and contacted amazon for the service.Believe me this is where it all started to become worser. The technician visited my home and confirmed it that the TV is having manufacturing defect as it doesn\\'t have any physical damage.From then it almost took 2 months of continued followup with amazon customer care to solve my issue. The issue was escalated multiple time and still was not resolved. I talked with superior associate still they also couldn\\'t solve my issue ,at last after multiple complaints and escalation on priority basis and to management level , they had to accept the return as an exception.OnePlus brand didn\\'t meet the expectations in its TV.,Good,I thought that oneplus name might have a good quality product for TV like mobiles, but they failed..After the purchase of TV with in a month the remote stopped working and when raised a issue with Oneplus customer care they sent a service person and he confirmed me that the remote is faulty and will be replaced with a new one, But after 90 days of complaint registered still they haven\\'t provided a remote  all they do is close the ticket after few days and asked to open a new one for the same complaint.They say that they don\\'t have a spare remote and this is the response from ONE PLUS CUSTOMER CARE and they don\\'t know when they might have it. 90+ days without remote that too on the early days after the TV lauch.They are not good with service all they are good with one time sales. WORST support in the industry.,Brand new One plus TVs are having issues with Bluetooth connectivity. I have observed this issue after the return window is over. Else could have returned it. One plus being such a reputed company this is not great on their part. Looks like they are now compromising on the quality to bring the prices down to compete with the like of other Chinese players. Bad experience. I would recommend to go for established brands such as LG, Samsung, Panasonic, etc,Super,नमस्कार अमेझॉन  मी 11 एप्रिल 2021 ला one plus 32 इंच स्मार्ट अँड्रॉउड tv घेतला होता फक्त 4 महिन्यात माझ्या tv ची दुरुस्ती निघाली आहे गेले आठ दिवस मी कंपनीकडे तक्रार करतोय पण अद्याप माझ्या तक्रारीकडे लक्ष दिले गेले नाही अमेझॉन वाले तर आपली जबाबदारी झटकून टाकत आहेत त्यामुळे मला वाटते अमेझॉन ची सर्व्हिस एकदम खराब आहे असे म्हणावे लागेतय,Overall experience is perfect the only problem I had was with my sound system. I have a Sony 5.1 sound system when I connect my TV to the soundbar the sound out is from both the TV and the external sound which is annoying. I feel as if I\\'m sitting in a room where the sound is echoing. A software update should fix the issue.,Stay away from this TV. This is worst thing you can buy with your money. Everything is pathetic about this tv except may be display, which is average at best. The remote is so slow, the inbuilt Chromecast never works, the WIFI connectivity is of the lowest grade among all devices.Worst of all they market it like, it is the best thing in the world. Please save yourselves and don\\'t fall for the trap.,It\\'s been only 3 days that I\\'ve been using it, but my initial reviews about this TV is fairly positive. The picture quality is very good, viewing angles could\\'ve been better. But the colour and full HD output is excellent. The sound quality is pretty average considering it is powered by dolby audio. The system lags a little but that can be excused considering the price. Overall this TV is catch and if you are on budget, this can be a go to option.I\\'ll update the review after thoroughly using this TV.,Excellent Marvelous Exciting,I returned the product as soon as i bought it. I considered this TV just for the brand value and trust i had on OnePlus since i own a oneplus phone. But OnePlus disappointed me.Pros:1. Cost2. Picture quality for this cost (720p)3. Android osCons:1. Sound quality- not good enough. Even 100% volume sounds like a 20%. Watching the same content on a OnePlus 5 was louder.2. Display looked flimsy and was not firmly attached to the frame.,Problem in hdmi port 2. Seems a software problem which led to random loss if signals on the hdmi port 2. Apparently, this is an issue in multiple sets. Finally the problem was solved after a s/w update. But now, any time tv is turned on it automatically switches off and has to be turned on again. Started after the latest software update. Host of other problems as well. Whenever media is played from usb, the tv goes into sleep mode and stops after 10-15minutes. This is despite disabling the sleep timer and other power save options as well. Truly ridiculous product with stupid problems even if you consider the price range. Between this and the phone started to realise OnePlus is just big hype. Products are sub-standard.,👌👌✌️✌️,Its been almost an year now i bought thus TV.  It really matched my al expectations. The picture quality is really good. The performance is flawless and never ever lagged as of now. The wifi response of TV is good it really gives smooth buffet free all the content. The contentivity of TV is really Good. It connects ti my wifi devices in no time. Few problems which i found was the audio quality is not upto the mark. The speakers are not loud enough. The voice recognition sometimes fails. Over all experience has been really good so far.,TV hangs randomly. Have to switch it completely off at least once a day and switch on again. The apps malfunction. Netflix exits on its own. Sometimes YouTube opens when we hit the Netflix button on the remote. Remote connectivity is also not fool proof. Sometimes it gets stuck while fast forwarding.To connect to different bluetooth device have to disconnect from the current one as there is no option to scan when connected to a device already.The tv has most features but they will malfunction sometimesVoice recognition doesn\\'t work,This tv takes so much time to get start...since we bought this it is having an issue with start up and sudden switch off issue. But we did not get the replacement. Even the amazon is not helping in this and says we don\\'t have policy for the return of the product. Why it should not be returnable on a day one.,Good,I just have a single suggestion. Don\\'t go for it. I ignored the reviews while purchasing the product stating there are lot of glitch in the tv software. I thought those glitches would go after the update. But it didn\\'t happen. The tv has lot of problems. It started from day 1.Problems with product:1. Youtube and other apps crashes all of the sudden.2. Volume key most of the times doesn\\'t work.3. Tv doesn\\'t respond to the remote almost all the time.4. Chromecast doesn\\'t work. Pros:1. Picture quality is average.2. Sound quality is good.3. Tv build up quality is good.,Plz dont purchase this specific product with amazone because of customer service center not provide you priority service because of you are amazons customer not OnePlus brand\\'s . So i m suggesting purchase threw brand so thet will give you proper service. After delivery of my tv i m getting my installation after 15 days . And now i want to claim warranty because of product issue with internet connectivity so now one plus customer care executive not replying me properly and Amazon customer service dont do anything because of warranty given by one plus not amazone .,Pathetic TV, It does not connect to the sony 5.1 music system, the guy who came was just in a hurry to fix it and run, did not clearly explain things and did not give solution to connect the home theatre despite asking him...Day 2 it is not detecting set top box even though the hdmi is plugged in properly...having a tough time with the tv...the biggest mistake in my life was to go for this TV....I will give ZERO STARS FOR THIS PRODUCT.Suggestion - Spend a little more and get a better established television brand,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0This TV is not great or not worst.I liked the picture quality in this range and bezel less view is awesome.(attached picture)However, not having aux support is minus. Sound quality of TV is poor. Poor and loud sound doesn\\'t help.And recently I\\'ve found a dead pixel on the screen, of which I\\'ve attached the picture. Technician came and checked it. Received an update saying waiting for warranty part. Will update how everything went once anything is done.Updating on 30/10/2020-> Received replacement part-> Received part was replaced to TV with original one-> Executive messed it up and TV is not showing true colors now. To say it is showing negative like colors-> Looking trust on amazon day by day.->Chatted with agent called Seizel who is stubborn and not at all listening.-> Rescheduled a service appointment.-> Will see what will happen and update here.Will not recommend this product strongly. Overall so so experience.,Like the TV overall. Good picture quality and software interface. I would recommend it. However, I feel the following could have been done differently:1. The sound quality isn\\'t all that impressive. The speakers aren\\'t loud enough. I\\'m using additional speakers with my TV.2. The processor used is quite slow. I see apps hanging at times which forces me to reboot the TV.3. The setup process wasn\\'t very smooth. When I first started the TV, I couldn\\'t install or update apps. I had to reset the TV to get the play store working.4. I can\\'t find a way to boot the TV to the home screen. It directly boots to the live TV interface. I don\\'t have cable or set-top box so this doesn\\'t make sense to me. If there is a way, I haven\\'t been able to find out how yet after searching a lot online.5. The base of the TV doesn\\'t feel stable. One has to take a lot of care if one wants to move the TV.6. It\\'s very inconvenient that the ports in the center especially because of point #5 if your TV is on the table. This makes it hard to access the ports. We have to move the TV to access the ports and #5 makes it difficult. The ports should have been placed on the side. Since USB is the port I\\'ll be using the most, I got around the problem by purchasing a USB cable that I can access without moving the TV.I went for the 43in TV instead of the 55in one just because I don\\'t have place to keep the larger 55in TV. If you have place for the 55in TV and if it fits into your budget, I would recommend going for that one. It would have been nice if OnePlus offered a 43in TV with all the 55in features for a slightly higher price than the current 43in TV.,Good TV. Superb picture quality. Craaaaazy User interface.😍😍♥️,Within a month of purchase tv started hanging, need to press remote 30-40 times to get it started. loggged a complaint on 18 april and upto today issue is not resolved and one plus customer care is saying we can not tell you when it will get repaired. first and last oneplus product. worst experience.,Review update on 2/10/2020,I have contacted customer care several times, and still they haven\\'t responded. Amazon customer care just says that they follow up the matter, but still I havnt received any updates regarding they matter, they just don\\'t value people\\'s money these people just wanna sell the product n don\\'t wanna know elwhat happens after saleI have one plus mobile, so I thought that TV will be having the same quality, The tv is awesome but the service from OnePlus/Amazon is worst. Display n all is good but tv don\\'t have any built in quality.. the main board of the Tv was damaged within one month of use and till now these Amazon/OnePlus people havnt done anything to get it replaced. It\\'s your money so please don\\'t invest in these items were they don\\'t even bother to give a service,Worst experience I am facing.. Dont go for appliances in amazon.. Installation process will not done by actual slot.. They will change as per their convenient.. My TV delivered on may 19 and installation slot booked on may 20 but no one contacted me for installation while call back to customer care they simply saying wait for weeks and weeks... If we wait for installation for weeks what is the use of buying these products.. Go for flipkart they are doing same day installation too.. Lose full hope on Amazon.. No one responding properly.. Please dont buy any appliances in Amazon.. If u buy u will face same problem which I am facing..,I had worst ever than worst experience with oneplus tv.1. Very low quality build material cheaper.2. Hanging, restarting problem when you switching between app.3. Google Assistant not working since I update the Android version.4.  Sound quality is the biggest setback, it sounds like a 3rd rate speaker and sound isn\\'t balanced. There is no clarity in the sound, you won\\'t be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen.5. Frame of TV isn\\'t durable, it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute.6. Remote is very slow. It takes time and you have to proper focus infront of tv.Bad policy of amazon.Technician from oneplus visit to solve but failed, technician from amazon come two time for inspection failed to solve. they are not able to do anythingSo, I will not suggest to purchase oneplus TV a lot of problems.,Writing this review after using the tv over than a month.The picture quality is doubtlessly good.Sound is average, not good for a big room.There are problems with remote control, for eg. sometimes when the volume button is pressed on tv remote, the set top box is responding with recall command.Chromecast does slow response.Sometimes the tv automatically goes to home page.A software updating is inevitable for addressing this problems.,DESIGN bug!!Currently version 9 had been installed in my device. Everytime restart (/Power on reset) takes the time to 27Jan2021 & 1:00PM. Because of this Google products aren\\'t working unless I change the time settings manually to current date and time.So I strongly recommend to take opinion from other users too.Am planning to raise service request on this issue to Amazon.,The display is Hdready n worst color saturation n brightness is killing after watching for 30 min for 7 days I ruined my eyes and when contacted Amazon they say follow up n complain to one plus in return one plus Rngennier resettled while tv which ruined the display more n it is so bright that u see white patches n if reduce the background light n brightness Color’s gets dark one plus not ready to listen or change the tv I think I have done blunder by purchasing only in the name of one plus … be informed pl don’t blindly buy see it to believ it,I have contacted Amazon multiple times and every time I get the same answer, there is no stock for replacement. I am clueless about what should be my next step.Extremely BAD after-sales services. worst.Better to get a TV from local store than such products.,Back in July 2020, OnePlus launched its budget TVs line up. I prebooked the TV on the launch day itself. After around two weeks, the TV went on flash sale for the first time. I received the TV after a week. I got the TV for around Rs.20,000. I prebooked the device for Rs 1000, which gave me two years extended warranty and Rs 1000 amazon cashback. Also, I got Amazon Echo Dot for free and a TV which I returned and got a refund for the same. It was a great deal, and so I decided to go for the OnePlus TV.With an excellent price tag, it comes with some exciting features like OnePlus Connect, Dolby Audio Enhancement, Oxygen Play, Chromecast, Google Assistant built-in and compatible with Amazon Alexa. I was very much excited to unbox and try the OnePlus TV. It also comes with Android 9.0. Unboxing the TV and attaching the table mount was an easy process. Also, setting up the device was very easy.Initial Impressions:When I first started the device, it was lagging a lot. However, there was already a software update available when I just started the device. I quickly updated the device, and the TV was still not working smooth enough. I think going 1 GB RAM is not enough. The picture quality is impressive, and the sound quality isn’t good at default settings. After tweaking the sound, it sounded terrific. Regarding connectivity, it was very smooth. The bezel-less design was the most attractive part of the TV.Design:The design is the most decisive point of the TV. It comes with a bezel-less display, an 88.5% screen to body ratio, and an enhanced viewing experience. It is slim from the back of the TV. Also, the ports are accessible quite easily. The table mount is also of decent quality, and there is a LED indicator in the bottom right corner of the TV. Overall, I loved the design and form factor of the TV.Rating: 4.5/5.Display:The display comes with a bunch of fancy features. It comes with a 1080p resolution and has DCI-P3 93% provides excellent colour reproduction. It uses Gamma Engine for picture enhancement and has features like Anti-Aliasing, Noise Reduction, Dynamic Contrast and colour space mapping. It also comes with various display tweaks such as sports mode, movie mode and many others. But I just tweaked them to get the best out of the TV. The default settings aren’t as good as expected. After tweaking, the colours and overall picture quality is soothing. Although, I think the 60fps doesn’t look smooth enough. It seems like 30-40 fps. To sum up, the display is excellent at this price point, although you need to tweak the settings to get the best out of the display.Rating: 4/5Sound:It comes with a 20W speaker output and also supports Dolby Audio Enhancement. The default sound settings aren’t sounding that great. After tweaking the audio settings, it works at its best. It is loud enough and no complaints apart from default settings.Rating: 4/5Connectivity:We get all the required connectivity options. It comes with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, Ethernet, RF Connection Input, HDMI Input, AV Input, Digital Audio Output and USB Ports. And the most legendary feature is the OnePlus Connect. We can control the TV entirely using a phone, take screenshots of the TV and save and share it. You can also control the TV actions such as volume, switch input, open apps, and turn off TV using Amazon Echo Dot. But there is an issue with the remote. TV won\\'t power on-off-on the first attempt. It also doesn’t have a dedicated input switch button.Rating: 3/5Pros:1)  Awesome colour accuracy, DCI-P3 93% and beautiful display quality.2)  Great sound quality with features like Dolby Audio Enhancement, Dialogue Enhancer, Dolby Surround etc3)  OnePlus Connect App features like taking TV Screenshots, controlling TV etc.4)  Aggressive price point.5)  Amazon Echo Dot integration and Google Assistant Built-In.6)  Bezel-Less display enhances the viewing experience.Cons:1)  It lags a lot at times and especially after turning on the TV from sleep mode.2)  TV won\\'t power on the first attempt 90% of the times.3)  Default Audio and Display Settings aren’t the best.4)  1 GB RAM isn’t enough for the TV.5)  No Wall Mount inside the box.6)  No input switch button on the remote.,Really loved the OPtv y seriesHave some lil probs bt thts finee, hope OnePlus will fix this in next update. Everything works fine so farLittle lag bt it\\'s okay it happens in every android TVOnePlus tv is handy with OnePlus mobile phones... But doesn\\'t support screen cast with Mi phonesAudio n video quality is top notch(need to change in settings). Overall best for this price range,Writing this review after a month of use.Pros :- compare to other tv in this price range sound quality is good- smooth installation after paying installation charges around 1k plus including wall mount- picture quality is goodCons :- voice recognition is annoying- Bluetooth paring is messy some time u need to unpair and pair again (in case of u r connecting a sound at ),No AUX cable Port,it doesn\\'t support AUX cable, Not possible to connect Home theater system to this TV, before purchasing they mentioned AUX cable support but after delivery no any AUX support pin in this TV, I am very Dissatisfied about this TV to connect external Sound system,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Picture quality is unbelievable,Cast on ScreenDelayed and audio is not syncPicture qualityPixel quality is not upto markArrived after 9 days of TV Delivered date.Poor service from Amazon, they have provided the installation service person out of service mobile number.Till the end of alloted time none of them called and best part is they have told to forward this issue to next 48 hours to solve this issue.The Amazon service is totally poor ,they have told that service person will provide log sheet and one year warranty time but that hasn\\'t been provided.There wasn\\'t any wall mount.So finally not worthy.,Bad product, no alexa support and aweful customer service.,Surprised that One plus TV not that good. Sound quality is poor. Rough.  No changes like cinema, voice, music, etc modes available as in other brands.  Had to put a soundbar to get a decent sound. Do please personally visit a showroom and listen to the TV sound before buying one plus TV.,It does have a really good picture quality and the sound is also satisfactory. Voice recognition works well and smart features are good. But there are so many bugs in the software causing Youtube and Prime Video to not work properly. I don\\'t know if it\\'s the CPU or the RAM it\\'s super slow and hangs for like minutes which will only get fixed if we pull the power line. Not having an RCA or 3.5mm output is bad. And most importantly, Alexa never works in the TV. The TV turns off and disconnect from the Wi-Fi causing Alexa unable to control it. Plenty of bugs in that sector and seriously disappointed with OnePlus coming up with such a product. But considering the price range, it\\'s good. Still can be improved way better.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I think this is great Android TV. I got this @14999. It is definitely worth the money. I am reviewing this product after using it for 10 days. One thing that really annoyed me is that I got this for 14999 and a week after the price dropped to 13999. I know it\\'s not a big deal but 1000 rupees is a big amount and I could have saved it.I will mention some pros and cons of product below and this might help you to make up your mind before you decide to purchase the product.Positive points:1. Picture Quality - The picture quality is superb at this price range.. It looks great, the colours are very bright and the contrast ratio of TV is also very good. The viewing angles on TV are also nice. I have uploaded a video regarding it, you can check it out.2. Smart cum Android TV - This is not just a Smart TV but it is an Android TV. This means you can install and sideload any apps you like as per your liking. I sideloaded a couple of apps and they all worked in first attempt. Earlier I was looking to go for Samsung and LG but both those TV in this price range only offers smart TV features and you can\\'t side load apps in a Smart TV. That\\'s why Android TV is best.3. Attractive Looks - One of the main reason why I bought One plus TV was because of the reason how good it looks. It almost looks like a bezel less display because the bezels on TV are super thin and sleek. The TV surely looks very attractive and it this price range you won\\'t find many TV\\'s as good looking as this.4. Operating system - The OS provided by one plus along with this TV is very smooth and it looks very clean and runs smooth most of the times. You might notice a little bit of lag while opening heavy application but it is hardly noticeable. In this price you can\\'t really ask for much as TV only comes with 1GB of ram and despite that TV runs pretty smooth.5. Connectivity - Connectivity is smooth and fluid. I connected my Xbox controller to play some games via Steamlink and my Bluetooth controller was detected as soon I plugged it in. WiFi also connects within 5 seconds of booting the TV. The boot time of TV is also decent enough and only takes 15-20 seconds for TV to boot.Negative Points:1. Sound - The sound quality of the TV is fine. It is nothing special and not bad either. The sound quality is little above average. I think it could have been a little better.2. Price - Price drop pissed me off 😂😂. I mean come on I paid 1000 extra and one week later the price dropped, that\\'s unfair. The TV is worth at 15k too but it could have been a classic deal if I got this at 14k! 😂3. Mirror Cast - Mirror casting from phone has a lot of delay even though I have a very fast network.All in all this TV is really good and I loved it.Important Info - You will be charged 299 rupees at time of installation of TV if you want to get the TV mounted on wall. The installation will be done at time of delivery and will be done by same people who deliver the TV. The delivery person will call you and inform you regarding the same. For 32 inches they will charge 299 and for above 32 inches you will be charged 399. My installation went very smooth and at first TV was not mounted properly so I requested person to put that in perfect position and he gladly did that for me. Overall I am satisfied with both the product and installation.,I am using this product for the last 2 months, over it is goodPicture Quality - Good, can it be betterSound - GoodSmart Feature - Average, voice recognization, and some other features are not working as expected.Remote Control - Very Bad, If you like to use a remote you need to be very close to the TV minimum 1Ft which is not expected. For a smart tv smart remote is a very important accessory without the remote you can\\'t do anything.Build Quality - Average, It\\'s could be better.,After delivered my one plus led tv On 31.10.2021 I Just purchase tata sky new d2h conection with HD pack and after installation as well as activation of HD PACK then same saw HD channel picture quality is vvvv bad dont buy for HD picture but SD picture not bad. Finally HD Users go to samsung, LG and videocon better than one plus 32inch pl.........thank for read.,It\\'s a marvellous Smart TV and extremely satisfactory features true to the OnePlus brand. But the biggest let down is the remote. It\\'s a really crude piece of plastic with jutting keys that are too cluttered closely and get activated at the slightest pressure. There is no luminous keys and contouring is really a big let down. It is a nuisance to use the remote and a very big disappointment.,I am writing this review after using this tv for 5 months and I received two updates in 5 months. Tv picture quality is amazing you get the best viewing experience but sound and it\\'s android is pathetic. From starting I see lags in this TV and I thought it get resolved after updates but it\\'s not resolved yet. Syetem interface is really slow. If you\\'re planning to buy this tv go for upper one plus TV not this one.,Picture quality.. AmazingRemote control.. Very soft speedy oprationSound quality.. Quite dispointed but not bad for 43 inches tv.Overall oneplus is best as other comparative.I am used oneplus mobile from last 6 years.Only amezon service was very bad not customer supportive.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0This is after 1 week of usage watch attached video, After speaking to Amazon Customer care they have assigned some Amazon service agent. The agent said he will fix the issue but even after 2 months there is no resolution to my issue. Never expected such a worst service from Amazon purchase. Even after reaching to 1+ CC, they said they will sendsome technician, but till now after 20 days no one reached. I request who ever see this review never ever purchase from Amazon site & 1+ products.I\\'ll give -5 rating,TV screen is defective after using 6 months. And Amazon is not providing warrenty claim for the TV. Upon raising service request, Amazon mark it completed without any technician. I suggest not to buy this product from Amazon because you will not get any warrenty claim if product is defective. One year warranty claim is fake, Amazon is not providing any warrenty claim. Don\\'t buy from Amazon.,Tv is absolutely value proposition. All required features are in the tv. If you have a one plus phone then its a quick sync for first time installation.Dislike- does not come with a wall mount stand & the hd cable requirement is a 2.0 cable... These offset you by an additional amount depending on what you add on..Also you need to proactively call the installation guys as they were not aware of my installation job...,Guys please don\\'t buy oneplus TV and it\\'s not a good product. We bought a new TV(3 Months old) and now it\\'s not working now. I have called the support and written back and forth emails but no support. It\\'s a worst support which I have never seen till today. Go for the MI or Samsung.,User interface is good. Sound quality is poor. Have to use external speakers for clear sound. Better options are available in this price range.Edit: After using the TV for 4 months. I have downgraded my rating form two to one star. Bluetooth connectivity is very poor. You get delayed response. The screen has started bleeding. Already have a bright line on the screen which is spreading with each passing day. Worst TV in this budget. Don\\'t buy it. Go for other options.,NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.I bought this product in October and the installation date given was 1 month later. Yet the technician had no mood to install it. Further, the Television worked fine for 3 months and one fine day its screen display went dark. We thought it was a Tata sky set talk box issue but later the other hdmi slot also went dark... I have been calling amazon every single day to provide a warranty repair... but for the past fifteen days they are not able to arrange a technician to visit us. I\\'m fed up calling and explaining the issue again and again. I\\'m now looking for a refund r else i will be forced to go to the consumer forum.,Total Waste of money. Got the tv in flash sale and in only 1 month remote control stopped working. Asked for technical support, the Amazon guy came for inspection and found the remote control faulty and told that it will get replaced but did not get any replacement till date.  Neither Amazon is responding properly neither one plus is responding. Will suggest buying some other product from a local vendor to get support on an immediate basis.,Picture quality is good. Look & Feel is good.Sound is 2/5..TV build quality is goodOnly 4GB memory is available out of 8GB.Oxygen Play is useless.Apps take ~10 sec to openSo much lag in TVTake 30+ sec to startApp close automatically because of lack of memoryDidn\\'t expect from OnePlus for such a pover product.Go for Realme TV,Bought the TV on 17th October 2020. Tv was not working by September 2021 and made a warranty claim at Amazon. They lagged it till December 4th and said they can\\'t provide warranty claim and the manufacturer has to provide.. OnePlus declined to provide warranty saying the warranty period was over.. I blame both Amazon and OnePlus for such pathetic service to their customers.,I bought this, the delivery boy asked me for OTP on entering the door. Then he plugged in the tv, holding in hand and said it turns on and was about to leave. I asked to put the tv on stand and then switch it on. He asked for OTP again and entered itThis meant delivery was done. Then i started looking at the picture and he left, i did\\'nt like the quality its grainy, lags a lot. I call Amazon and turns out my tv sale was final and not eligible for refund.Must have been written in fine print, why didn\\'t the delivery boy explain this to me. I feel cheated with a TV i don\\'t think i\\'ll be able to use.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Dont buy this tv. Very bad experience. Far better MI tv.1. I have used Airtel DTH for watching tv, when I start tv , in the tv side corner moving option of Netflix you tube etc. Why this option reflecting here while watching tv, there is no any option to remove this.2. Not pair remote with dth remote3. When I start tv , there is no option to  set automatically redirect HDMI option, so normally start my tv, I don\\'t want online content, I want only dth connection tv. you have to always  manually select HDMI.4. Return option is not available.,NO SERVICE AFTER SALEno person comes for service in warranty period, keeping Calling Amazon they just keep on reshedule it every week. u can check the service rating of tvpicture quality > its 1080 max supptred. clarity is there but if u want more go for 4k and more moneysound > i dont need my home theatre now in average close bedroom it sounds sufficentconenctivty> from andriod mobile to my laptop ,pendirve can play anything hereabout my orderfirst i got tv which was faulted ,no installtion guy came from service provider that was shocking form me that too 5 times they said NO comingamazon support team helped me nicely got my order replaced and installed .,While tv is good the fitting (wall mount) from Amazon is pathetic and flimsy, the tv is literally shaking and might fall off with a slight touch, I’d rather recommend buying it from somewhere else or directly from store, this is my third review as my other reviews are not added unless I rate it high, hypocrisy from Amazon,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Really had a nice viewing experience. Delivery was delayed a bit. Shipped through Delhivery Courier service.Myself installed the TV though the technician is scheduled.One plus doesn\\'t provide any wall mounting brackets.TV is light weight.Sound quality is superb good.Video quality perfect at this price range.As I have checked the reviews I saw that some of them have faced remote connectivity is very slow. But I have experienced a very good response with remote control.I didn\\'t face any Network connectivity issue also.I was able to access the internet through mobile hotspot and was able to play 1080 pixel quality videos on youtube.While accessing the TV through One Plus connect app both the TV and mobike should be connected to same Wifi network. If we get a call it automatically mute the volume. It\\'s a good option.Finally it\\'s very easy to operate as it have original android.Without any second thought you can go for it.,Picture quality : good.Sound quality: okConnectivity: good. Having problems with oneplus connect app. May be some usage guidelines will help.Remote operating: worst. I think this is one of main drawback of this product. We have to point the remote staight into the bottom of the tv other wise remote control os not working. I guess it\\'s do with the ram.,The display went wrong after hardly a month without any physical damage to the screen. While going through the reviews what I understand is this issue of display is a common problem and not an isolated issue to this brand. Though in the Amazon Q&A it is mentioned that the product is having Comprehensive 1 year warranty, no body has till date attended my complaint. The product is having service centres only in limited area. Never buy this TV.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Was initially happy with quality for the cost. But stopped working within a month of installation.Plays for and about a minute and screen goes rainy. Then TV switches off automatically. Won\\'t turn on for next 5minutes even if mains power is restarted.,I hardly write product reviews but the great experience with the product made me go for it.Writing this review after a use of 2 months. Excellent product fulfilling all the expectations. Picture and sound quality - I am more than happy with it. Nothing less than established brands. I initially was worried as I had not used or heard much about 1+ TV sets, but I am completely satisfied.Got it for 15.5k in offer period with exchange of my 9 years old 32\\'LED.Wall installion\\\\feature settings was done at the time of delivery with no hassle.Cons:1. SD channels quality is distinguished over HD due to increased screen size. Streaming HD data gives theatre feel.2. Remote batteries come from local brand, do not last longer. I switched to Duracell in less than 2 months.Would strongly recommend to go for it.Note: Holding a fifth star to watch for the prolonged usage experience.,Not able to connect with AlexaNot able to connect with OnePlus connect app.Google assistant on TV do not understand anything.Can anyone help me connecting Alexa and OnePlus connect app with this tv.Several emails written to OnePlus support team.. but no reply,Pros:1. Excellent Picture Quality2. Sound Quality is Good ( but don\\'t know why many are telling negative about the sound quality )3. Remote Control is sleek and responsive4. Connectivity is goodCons:1. Very high Picture Brightness ( not good for kids )2. Sometimes Connect mobile app works weird3. Lagging ( very rare )Over all best television at this price with some issues here and there.,I have purchased one plus tv 32 inch from amazon .after purchase with in 20 days time my tv screen got blured completely so i done the complain in one plus.than they replaced my complete pannel of tv .its been only 12 more days and once again this screen got blured .its showing blank .suddenly it got went of.and one more thing this one plus tv for this they guys have provided customer care number on that number nobody will reply till you call them for continuously for 1 hour .i want my money back please help and i request amazon to take my this feedback seriously and band this one plus tv from selling .i am going to put this detail feedback on all my socialmeadia connectionONE PLUS TV ARE THE MOST PATHETIC TV I HAVE EVER PURCHASED .,Picture quality is awesome when compared with other TV in the market with similar price range. But the TV operation is slow after 4 months of use... I use prime, hotstar, Netflix switching between app and sometimes selecting movie is also slow. Worst part is you can not turn ON the TV simple in a push of a button.. sometimes you have to do tricks to turn on the TV. Happy with the sound and Picture quality please improve the above issues.,TV seems to be very good for the price after 2 days. But service from Amazon is pathetic for fitting. They sale TV on exchange, takes away the old tv and delivers new one. Then they keep you waiting full day for TV fitting and when you call the service person, he says he doesn\\'t have time. Call center says they cam resolve only in 48 hours. So 2 days you are left with no tv. We were left with no choice but to fit it ourselves. Will never recommend anyone buy tv and trust Amazon for installation and fitting services.,Worst product ans worst installation. Waiting for installation from the last two weeks. Everytime installation was cancelled due to non availability of stand.,Big big disappointment from Oneplus, today my OnePlus tv installation was done, and after installation people went then after that TV started flickering, and after 10 sec tv is auto shutting down.I complained to Amazon and now they are arranging repairing at my home as the product is under warranty.OnePlus tv in India has given its warranty repairing to Amazon and there is no OnePlus repairment center in India.I had used OnePlus maximum products and was fan but this TV has broken all the trust by seeing the cheap quality of TV.Worst quality from OnePlus ☹️☹️☹️☹️,All are good but more lags and buggs  ,some times picture stoping remort Not working properly,  and the OnePlus connect is operating but media option missing in that Soo u can\\'t see ur phone videos directly in phone, please update and clear the buggs,If you look closely my playstation 4 Is connected to the tv and this is what it looks like....................\"HANDS DOWN THE WORST PRODUCT YOU CAN BUY\". HDMI keeps switching back to home on it\\'s own. And HATS OFF TO AMAZON INDIA I HAD TO SIT DOWN FOR 90 MINS FOR JUST TO ASK CUSTOMER SUPPORT TO REPLACE THE PRODUCT. AND THE TECHNICIAN WILL COME AFTER 3 DAYS THEN IT WILL GO BACK WHICH WILL TAKE 2 TO 3 DAYS AND THEN THEY WILL SEND A NEW ONE WHICH WILL TAKE ANOTHER 2 TO 3 DAYS SO I AM STUCK WITH A NON WORKING TV FOR NEARLY A WEEK.AND I AM NOT SURE IF THE NEW ONE WILL WORK OR NOT. WHILE MY MONEY IS SOMEWHERE IN A BILLIONAIRE\\'S ACCOUNT WHICH IS NOT EVEN ONE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT HE HAS IN HIS ACCOUNT.THANK YOU AMAZONTHANK YOU ONE PLUSSO MY OPINION IF YOU SHOULD BUY THIS TV IS TAKE YOUR MONEY AND GIVE IT SOME HOMELESS PEOPLE AT LEAST YOU WILL HAVE DONE A GOOD DEED.SORRY ABOUT THE RANT,Poorest post sales services ,Amazon denied and asked to contact One plus at your local area and authorised oneplus service centres too denied that we don’t take Television complaints,what a customer will do ,at last Television in dustbin in less than one year ,don’t buy electronic goods from Amazon,Don’t buy this TV. Pathetic quality of product as well as their customer support. Within 2 months it’s display panel become dead and nothing can be seen. By complaining about the product I came to know that they don’t have another display panel of this model to repair it. They even don’t have the fresh unit to replace. It’s been a month but they couldn’t help me out. Very poor quality of product and shameful customer support.,Worst TV i had ever seen in my life , its turn into black and white TV after using 15 days and many more problems with its.I had requested for repair in September2020 and still waiting for repair. Its more then three months and its shows waiting for parts , ever i called many times to oneplus customer care regarding this. And they provide only new dates not solution. Totally Fed up with oneplus service . Never purchase oneplus TV . Its my request to u all.,It is an avg. product. almost or i must say  exactly similar to MI. No way near to the one plus experience.Buy MI or one plus Y series, features/OS everything is same. Samsung/Sony/LG users can easily feel the huuuge difference...So far working good but sometime TV do not switch on with single click from remote. OS is slow and quite a lot of apps does not work like voot. Using its chromecast functionality to play shows from non working apps.All in all avg. product. Good for temporary use,I was little bit confused with respect of price but i chosen brand over the price and i found the best quality, Awesome picture, great sound and very light which can be put up anywhere over the table or easily can be mounted on wall. I got the product on next day morning of order. I also had ordered dish tv which has been set next day delivery. Satisfied with Amazon service. Thanks.,Don\\'t buy OnePlus TV at all.. they might be good but their service is horrible.. I got my TV on 1st July.. however it got installed on 18th July.. but here the catch is not by OnePlus technician but I have to spend money and book the installation by Urban Clap... But Amazon customer care said they will have the amount reimbursed,Worst service ever . I bought a new tv from Amazon it hardly worked for a month. From then it has been dead in my house not turning on .tried to book Amazon waranty services atleast 10 times and have been waiting more than a month. But neither they are exchangeing nor they are changing the parts of tv. Finally I am going to report in consumer court.becaus they don\\'t care at all after sale.,Bluetooth and Wifi didn\\'t worked on this so called SMART TV. Even Pathetic Amazon service. They kept on suggesting TV inspection even after I confirmed that every normal check was done and TV was reset based upon suggestion from Oneplus technical support.After endless calls and 4 days they agreed for replacement which was to be done in 10 DAYS WHILE NEW TV WAS AVAILABLE NEXT DAY. I have instead retuned it and bought a Sony TV.,Got installed today 25/1/21. Everything seems perfect. Picture quality is good , sound quality is nice ( not big but nice , maybe when in summer coolers will run , there can be some problem in hearing , but that I can only confirm in summer ) , smart features & remote control is also very nice & easy to use . Voice command feature I was still not able to use , as I did not get much time with led . YouTube , prime video are working fine .,picture quality is good but Sound quality worst and build quality also not so much good,The best android TV in this price range especially the picture quality is the best. Sound is not that great but if you have dth connection which provides dolby sound like Tata Sky then this tv dolby feature works very well. All other options are almost the same in all andriod TV series and an extra feature is after updating the software there is a app called Oxygen Play which automatically saves data of our viewing content from different OTT platforms and helps us to resume whenever we want to continue watching. Display wise it\\'s the best.,Pricing wise it is goodPicture quality is goodBut they using normal grade panelLight weightSound level is low when compared to other smart TV segments in this price range like other brands mi,realme&VUBluetooth,wifi, is the best featuresWall mount should buy separatelyEven official oneplus wall mount is not available in online technician provides other brandThat is higher price than the oneplus399₹ approx if the right availability in oneplus brand that priced at ₹199 only but bad luck it\\'s not availableOverally speaker volume must be important to improve in upcoming oneplus TV\\'sUsing a good grade panel gives lot more quality I think,My schedule of my installation ws on 9 may bt nobody came & also nobody call me today on 12 wn I call Amazon they the person who ws on call otherside shows that they dnt hv any respect to customers & he says person fr installation will came on 17 total 8 days delayed bt they dnt fell sorry fr this & they say that if I open box warranty will go I will nt gt warrantyThis ws gift fr smone it birthday ws on 11 may & I will hv to wait till 17may to see if tr is tv inside or something alse,1) Installation team did not show up on scheduled day2) had to keep calling to get the installation done3) Mount was not provided for4) If charged, mount for 43\" Costs 299/- But the installation boy charged us 500 for it5) installation agent was very rude , arrogant and unprofessional6) Wasnt ready to give us a reciept for the extra amount when asked,Service was the worstest from oneplus... The tv got problem with the motherboard and for the repair service i was still waiting from August 26th 2021 (more than 2 months) still waiting nothing happened... Everything was ok with the tv... But never expect any service from oneplus customer support or oneplus... when you call oneplus customer support you have to wait on the line for the whole day to get irresponsible answers from oneplus... Amazon will help you but i request please dont go for oneplus products... worst customer support i have ever seen...,Product is ok but one plus service is horrible.Yes I mean it..its horrible..!!!I need some technical assistance as I\\'m unable to connect my router with smart tv & I requested couple of times to pay a visit and give demo. Unfortunately no one turned up till date & giving lame excuses.I\\'m surprised if I have been treated like this within product warranty what I\\'ll do after warranty exhausted.One plus Customer care is pathetic a major cause of concern please don\\'t ignore this.Tv has couple of technical issue while mapping with other external device like lan, Bluetooth & all.,Pros: Excellent picture quality. Voice quality is good but needs go to settings and do setup to genre you watching. I set it to sports for everything. I bought it in annual sale and it is nice prodct under this price.Cons: No bootup sound or beep when powered on or used remote so you have to press remote quite hard. Takes good 1-1.5minuts to boot up.Overall verdict - Satisfied with the picture quality and sound quality of product. Could use a notification sound to save my remote though.Amazon installation service is not great as they force you to purchase wall mount stand and charge the installation.  Also the TV was delivered on time but it sat there over the weekend as the installation person could only come after 2days. Moreover they void your warranty if you go for DIY installation or setup which is pretty easy to do. Strange from amazon.,Picture and sound quality are good but occasional glitches with respect to frozen or slow response while content surfing. This needs tv to be restarted to make it smooth again. My mitv which is slightly cheaper works flawlessly in this aspect and OnePlus has a lot to improve via software update maybe,I wish I had read the review’s on oneplus official facebook page. 99% people are complaining about the service providing by one plus.Now let me share what happens with me:I bought this TV through amazon with amazon and one plus brand warranty. Now I am facing some issues with my TV. I called the amazon service to fix my tv and I called them many many times and no one visit at my home to fix the tv ( to let you know I am living in Delhi-NCR not himalayas) so when amazon is failed to do that they escalated my request to oneplus and now it’s more than a month I am still calling them to fix my tv and every time they said we escalated your request to related department kindly wait for 3 days to visit the technician, and after 3 days you called they again saying the same thing again and again. it’s really frustrating.So I SUGGEST DON’T GO WITH ONE PLUS TV,I was bit worried about the lag reported by some reviewers. Fortunately I did not face any problems. The picture quality is very good, sound is also good, menu options work well except voice commands which I couldn\\'t get running.Couldn\\'t have asked for more at this price point.Highly recommended.Update: Got the voice recognition running. Great performance 👌👌👌,I am really afraid about purchasing the tv because of the negative reviews I have seenBut after I have bought the product I am so satisfied with it and I must not have bothered negative reviewsThe picture quality is good mines an SD CONNECTION It would be awesome with a HD connectionMany said the sound is bad but I don’t see it like that because at 20% of the sound everyone at my home in any room of the houseYou need the adjust the sound at sound settings for better sound with the Dolby given the sound is fascinatingIt is good budget tvBought it along with AlexaMine is a remote location but got the installation done right the next day after the item has been received,The tv is very good, the picture quality is outstanding for a tv in this price range. The sound is pretty good if you select the right setting but the default audio settings produce terrible sound but you can\\'t expect much more with a tv in this range. I don\\'t think you can find another tv with these qualities in this price range other than the Samsung TVs I guess. But trust me, play a 4k video and you\\'ll be mind blown by the picture quality and colours even though it isn\\'t a 4k tv.,I bought this product and it\\'s 6month passed. tv accessories seems to have some malfunction( technically we don\\'t know for sure) and technicians doesn\\'t arrive at location to diagnose the actual reasons for the problem. Digicare reps won\\'t call on your appointments timelines and kill your time and doesnt show up at location. Instead on various followups some un authorised person calls and make assumptions from the technical issues as per customer feed and they encourage you to buy a new accessories instead of actually checking the problem at the location. My experience with this OnePlus tv has been below average for the kind of picture quality, sound system and BT connection isues and other features are not so fascinating. i suggest fellow customers to buy another chepaer product with best installation and warranty claims but not this kind a item with such marketing strategies.,Very worst tv I have ever seen. Worst kind of support from one plus. Recommend not to buy this one. Bought this one on Dec 2020, after 2 months of usage screen flickering issue occurred, I try to claim warranty from one plus from march month till now. Raised many cases to one plus support team but there is no proper update. Every week they are telling new update. Now finally yesterday they said again like tech visit will be arranged, from Mar month I have received 3 tech visit. 2 month once I am getting tech visit but no proper resolution given for my problem.Now I called with amazon team and asked them to support  me. Now am going with amazon let me see whether one plus people take my concern now.,Picture Quality is quite Amazing and I am fully satisfied with that picture quality. Gamma engine is one of the major plus point in this. Comming to Remote Control, it is some what average, even if we click on the buttons on the remote some times it will not function and sometimes when we we are watching channels in the set top box, it abruptly comes back to home UI inteface not sure why it is happening, may be it will be getting updates in further comming days. Now coming to sound, I didn\\'t like the Sound much, when we are watching any TV channels which are connected through Set top box, it\\'s Okay and when we are watching any movies in Netflix or Prime Video, Sound is totally disaster, even we can\\'t hear the dialogues clearly. This is one thing that I was disappointed a lot. Now I must plan to buy a sound bar. If the TV sound quality is good, I may not buy this. This is the thing that OnePlus must definitely look into it. If you want good picture quality and you previously have a speaker/sound bar then you can blindly go to this. If you are not having any of the sound bars/speakers the choice will be of your own.,Hi, i have bought this TV and it is good but the seller took 2300 for wall mount which i get it for 600 in Amazon so please purchase only the TV and wall mount separately,>> It doesn\\'t connect to my 100 Mbps 5g Excitel netwrok. It doesn\\'t show it in the first place.>> Sound quality is very poor. No base at all.>> Picture quality is not great.>> System is very slow and laggy.>> It lags a lot when I cast my phone.>> I can\\'t cast my laptop onto it. Even when I can it lags a lot and takes whole eternity.My suggestion would be to not go for this model. Instead buy something else like for eg TCL.,After 7 months of usage.TV panel stopped working.On lodging Compaint, Its been more than 10 days & one plus service partners is unable to tell that how long will it take to replace TV panel.Dont buy this TV,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Seems all the review videos on youtube and all the reviews were paid for this TV, pathetic performance, not even complete 6 months and all the smart features of the tv stopped working. Calling one plus tv customer care but no body helped with any visit or technical support online. The picture quality, sound, connectivity issues were already bad but we ignored them initially but now it just stopped working and all we have a normal LED tv without remote and without any smart feature....I don\\'t know if this review will help me too but i just wanna warn people planning to buy this, please Don\\'t....,I purchased it through Amazon on 20.10.2020. on 21st i went to my native for 15 days and returned on 4th. the TV was performing good till then. On 16th Nov from night 8 pm there occurred a picture problem and half of the screen went black and other half went pink.i am regularly calling oneplus customer care but is yet to get a satisfactory answer.If they don\\'t replace my product with a new one , am going to place a consumer case registered against them.Don\\'t believe in this product. Go for Samsung and LG instead.,I’ve been using this TV for 3 weeks now and I’ve only used it with my WiFi connection. I’ll be brief in my review.1. For the amount you are spending, you will not be disappointed.2. Picture quality is good but at this price point. If you compare with TVs at a higher price point, you will be surely disappointed. Colours are bright but could have been better.3. Sound quality could certainly have been better. Don’t try to raise the volume too high or else the sound will break. It is  acceptable if you have a average size room say, 10’x10’ but anything larger than that and you will feel the inadequacies.4. There is a certain noticeable lag in operation but nothing you can’t live with. And you also get used to it.5. Again, I will say that the amount which you are spending, it serves the purpose.6. There are other brand TVs also at similar price but this was the latest model and hence I purchased it.7. I’m satisfied. Giving 4 stars and I don’t think that you can get a 5 star rating TV in this cost.,To start with the weight is definitely light hence easy to install on a wall. Good decent picture quality for the money one spends on it. Can\\'t expect clarity like expensive one on this. Now the down sides of this android TV.1. The sound quality is bad, dialogues can\\'t be heard sometimes and you really have to crank up the volume to an irritable level.2. Remote is definitely not the most responsive of the lot. Each button needs to be pressed couple of times while pointing at the right direction for it to work.3. Speak function is worst. Absolutely non usableBuy only if you use your television seldomly.,Plz Help Regarding my Tv One Plus Y series , I need Replacement Becoz Tv have Issue in HDMI port Pictures are flipping and One Plus Doesn’t Have Parts Waiting From Last 1 weeks while I ordered recently this One new TvIt get resolved and Fully Appreciated,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Guys , this was by far the best purchase I have made , my wife is a 1 plus fanatic, so I purchased this thinking \\'it won\\'t be that good\\' .

Premium look and premium quality,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Don\\'t buy this TV. Worst experience. Bought it only 4 months back when it was launched. But now the screen display is flickering and stuttering. The OnePlus service team is so poor that they could not even respond properly. Oneplus may be a good brand for high end mobiles but not for any other consumer goods. I just want some technician to arrive at my place to sort the issue out. No one is responding properly. Service team sets a bad example for OnePlus. Oneplus service team is not like for samsung or any other big brands. Their network is so small that they can\\'t provide the service on time and in many areas.,TV is good. Light weight and easy to use.It is so light that I have to go to the warehouse to pick that up because the delivery person says he can\\'t come to deliver. And he was okay if I complain. I got the TV after almost 10 days when it had reached the warehouse. And the best part the delivery team were not even concerned about it. I just walked in after so much frustration and picked the tv and then I got a msg on my phone saying Your order is out for delivery. I hope Amazon does take some action.,TV is ok for use. Don\\'t expect too much from oneplus . I expected a lot more from TV like oneplus phones.Pros-◆Good picture quality not better◆software is user friendly◆connectivy is fast◆responsive remote  ( 1st time faced lag. After updated it solved)Cons-◆Low sound◆response of voice command is a lit more lag◆viewing experience is not as good. 90° view get better quality .But in 120° showing a shadow◆tv mirroring is difficult,This TV has really, really by the picture quality. The grey uniformity of the screen is really very bad (even worse than a lot of much cheaper TVs). The viewing angles are also the worst I have ever seen in a TV... The sound is very, very bad and I wouldn\\'t recommend this TV to anyone. Despite the Android TV advantage, this TV is much worse compared to TV which cost half of this.,I ordered new tv considering my old tv would be exchanged  but delivery guys rejected it on ground that there are some marks on screen.My question why would I exchange new TV from amazon when  the reason for which i ordered was not satisfied.Advise - stop cheating people on name of exchange as your guys will come and request pls pay the difference amount and take the products etc. no point in going for exchange.I could have gone without  ordering a new tv with my older LG which is working fine till now.Exchange is tactic to fool customers, in past also same has happened with mobile also, at that time I rejected the order but this time i was trapped due to presence of family and kids .,Wall mount was not provided by technician during installation (since they did not have stock) and now I\\'m asked to pay for wall mount brackets. Isn\\'t this something that will be provided by technician during installation. For trying to adjust for technician request for handing the wall mounting bracket later, I\\'ve to pay extra price. This isn\\'t something expected from Amazon.,I buy one plus tv with high expectations but not good (picture and sound quality good) one plus led tv hdmi not working last 2month no service centre no response for one plus tv .any service person come he tell just u r hdmi port not working wecannot handle and we cannot repair last 2month I cannot seeing my entertainment.my suggestion pls think and buy money not come easy,PLEASE BHIAYON DHYAN DE,MERE SATH DHOKHA HUYA HAI.

Upon a lot of convincing my Dad finally trusted a One Plus TV as he is traditionally a fan of Samsung, Panasonic and other \"established\" TV\\'s. The One Plus TV not only has impressed him but the prompt installation and customer support has helped increase his faith in an otherwise \"new\" company. Coming to the TV the picture quality is amazing and the voice recognition along with Alexa works like a charm. Despite many negative reviews on the sound quality I found it satisfactory and absolutely upto the mark. I DONT NEED ANY EXTERNAL SPEAKERS as the sound quality is DAMN GOOD. Coupled with a good high speed Wifi this TV is a STEAL at this price. Other smart LED TV\\'s are 10k expensive and with no other Notable increase in any features (as I have seen in many of my friends homes).,OnePlus has done a commendable job with this product. Great picture quality with Good sound. Best in its segment. Don\\'t go for YouTube reviews, I think that\\'s the drama made by the youtubers on reviewing this product. This product has nice built quality as well.Only thing is you need to update its firmware when you connect to internet for the first time. Because picture quality is not as good as after update. 👍👍👍,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0It is completely budget tv..Picture quality goodAudio quality poorRemote and voice recognize averageThere is no audio output for old home theatresBuild quality not that greatNo wallmount we need to pay extra 600rs while installing (worst wall mount)It is not slim tvPathetic installation service,First of all i was in dilema that tv will in good condition or not but than i purchased it and its out of the expectation deleivery was fast , installation was on time and cool features and also its pocket friendly product  overall experience its an awesome 5star thums up,I purchased tv but in a month when I connected amazon fire stick i realized the ARC-HDMI port was not functioning. I filed complaint to ONEPLUS first and Amazon then. The Technician never visited my home after his only first visit in NOV 2020. Always made false reporting, always rescheduling and cancelling visit appointments and even after then just updating \"waiting for parts\" I thank Amazon who accepted return of my television in January 2021 and till 9th March 2021 he was making false reporting; ultimately i told him about my return of television and he ended the service ...... I HAVE TO SURRENDER A GOOD TELEVISION (just a small defect) BECAUSE OF THE PATHETIC SERVICE.  Later I purchased Hisense 43A71F from FLIPKART with 3 years complete protection plan of flipkart ( my OnePlus tv also had a extended warranty/ protection policy) . I changed TV brand and purchase app just because of this service..... I hope this feedback will take some measures which will benefit your future customers!,OnePlus is a brand what i know , it gives premium quality product ,but in this y series tv of 32 inches  ,its not upto the mark  , i will rate by its performance 3/5 , product it good but performance is not upto the mark if i compare to MI 4 tv as in same segment , infact its performance is comparatively more better than oneplus tv , .Issues what i am facing1. When you will power on the tv. First it shows blue screen for 3-5 seconds ,i don\\'t kniw why .2. Performance is low it tooks overall 20 second to start completely.3. While give indication to power on by your remote you will not to know ,is it actually on or off because it takes around 3-5 second to show response .4. If you are restless person then this tv is not for you ,i recomend personal .5.but all these software kind of issue ,it may be resolved over updated maybe ,but for now i dont want to go with this oneplus y series tv . I am not 100 percent satisfied.Or next its your call whether you want to go with this product or not . OnePlus is a good brand but this y series may bring it down.,Good,Panel damaged within 10 months of purchase. Less than 1 hour of daily use on average. The company doesn’t have spare parts available. Have been asked to wait 1-3 months for panel replacement. Better off buying VU tv. Much better picture quality, reliability and service availability.,Tv got delivered in good condition and installation went wellcoming to the tv picture quality it\\'s awesome . Got all ott applications . had a problem with oneplus connect app connecting to TVI have seen many complaining about sound but in my opinion its crazy. i want to tell u guys 1 thing if you want theatre experience go to theatre its a TV not a sound system so stop complaining about sound.At last go for it dont change your mind on other companies and waste timeAs these r my early days ill update abt the TV again after a monthupdatesound and picture quality are crazyoneplus connect app is laggyhaving issues with screen mirroring(hoping for the update) directly , But i have no issue with screen mirroring from youtube, prime...... applicationssupports 3rd party applications alsoas the ram is low it takes time to load apps once cache is formed apps open at good speedRi8 now best tv in budget segment,Installation team took 8 days after delivery.It is bluetooth remote, but sometimes it won\\'t work. We have to use it as IR remote.TV is very slow to operate and apps crashes frequently.Connecting mobile remote is a hectic process.Even if you change color mode in tv, it will work with default color settings while watching tv through AV port.Poor panel quality.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I am writing this review after 6 months of usePurchased on jan 2021Pros:Good picture quality: Color gamet is really working. You can see vibrant color on Screen. Fully satisfiedAudio: audio is ok for one single room and ya ofcourse Dolby sound is also working niceDesign: bazzle less design will attracts attention while tv is ON or OFF, it looks very good like a modern smart TVCons:1. Vertical line on screen:After 6 months of use i got single vertical line on screen which is very disappointing for a brand One Plus, Tv was ideal on Wall and one day i saw a vertical line next day i got 3 lines and now as you can see in the picture there are 6 bold lines on the screen.I have called to customer care and no response after 1 week.2. Remote voice command is not working from very first day of installation but that was ok in front of screen fault.3. You have to pay 300 Rs as a installation charge for 32inch TV,Writing this review after using it for a month.I am using this as just smart tv not with any cable connection or DTH service.1.Sharpness gets set to 0 automatically out of no where and u will watch your tv playing everything in black & white and once this happens TV never works the same as before.2. Picture quality is not so great.3. TV gets hang in all the applications.4. It\\'ll go back to initial screen while you are watching something.5. Sometimes it works as radio you play some video but u can only hear it and entire screen will become blank 😑6. Amazon warranty claim service is pathetic, I\\'ve raised a request and waited for 5 days still no technician had visited from OnePlus to provide service and amazon doesn\\'t have any information regarding that, simply they offer this service,As per the scheduled installation date Technician not reported & after 4/5 days also it\\'s not done.Finally we have arranged Technician from Local area & Fixed it.1.Fast delivery2.Sound&Picture quality good3.Price Ok4.Service : No Service team in odissa? After receive the material we wait for install it 1week but nobody reached for installation.Finaly arranged Technician from out side & Fixed itWe never expect that the poor service from Amazon Team,PLEASE DON\\'T BUY THIS SCRAP PRODUCT ...  I CAME TO KNOW ... I WASTED 24,500 AFTER 5 DAYS OF USAGE.  IF YOU BUY THIS DEFINALTY YOU WILL LOOSE PIECE OF MIND.SAD STORY STARTS NOW ...I am writing review after 5 days of usage.  Product got delivered on 18th Feb 2020 and Installation is done on 27th Feb 2020 (9 days after delivery).  I can\\'t able to use TV without wall mounting because of limitations at my home.  Basic functionality \"Display\" is lost after 5 days of usage. I could not able to return because of return policy of 12 days of delivery. (return button is disabled).  Initially I thought it was setup box problem that after troubleshooting I came to conclusion that it was TV display problem.SAD STORY CONTINUES ..... I raised a complaint to amazon( 6th march) they told that they will send a technician to check problem and scheduled appointment is on 31 March 2020.  Now I have wait for 25 days to technician to come and inspect.Brand value of ONEPLUS in mobile category is GOOD , When it comes to TV , ONEPLUS made a scarp product. If basic functionality display is not working as expected  --- ITS BRAND VALUE IS ZERO.Coming to AMAZON ...  I didn\\'t buy a product on road side PLATFORM.  Didn\\'t expect worst service from AMAZON for SCRAP product (Inspection after 25 days after complaint)SAD STORY CONTINUES .....  Don\\'t know if AMAZON will help me or not,I had ordered this tv as a gift for my sister. After 15 days their is a black line appear on the screen and after some hour whole screen became black and nothing can be seen on the screen. Now we can only hear the sound with this tv. Because it happens after 15 days so Amazon refused to give us replacement and suggest us to contact with OnePlus. Now OnePlus taking its own time to decide whether they will give me a new replacement or they will repair this crap. Don\\'t know how much time they will take?,We faced a lot of issue with the TV. Everything related to tv is good but the smart part really is disappointing. We have to wait 1-2 minutes before the TV turns on. Google assistant is not responsive most of the time. Not a smooth experience. And just for reference my internet speed is 200 mbps.Will recommend you all buy a normal TV and use amazon firestick instead. Firestick is smarter than the smart TV by one plus.,I love OnePlus products and I hve a device bullets as wel TV, all there products r too good n I will surely recommend all my frndz and family members to purchse TV, dolbby version in TV has got a amazing audio effects, I am proud to tell all my frndz dat am an OnePlus user and own it, never expected dat I would really feel so comfortable using TV also there z a very good quick response form customer service also itz easy to book a repair frm OnePlus care app, as world z becoming smarter even booking a repair z so simple by using user friendly app and the technician repairs it in front of our eyes which is really amazing and happy to tell woooow and a big salute to OnePlus brand.Cheers!Manjunath Rey,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Purchase this during Amazon sale for my room and it’s an excellent TV. Have been using it for more than a month now and there have been not any issues such.Pros:1. Amazing clarity2. Amazing sound for a small room3. Chrome cast or casting works neatly4. All the apps work extremely fine.5. The Bluetooth remote is extremely good and there is a knack to use this - it gets switched off due to inactivity so if you want to quickly turn on your TV you’ll have to press on the power on button twice with a gap of 3 to 4 seconds in between.Cons:1. There is a lag while starting the TV and some apps.2. Voice recognition take some time.Lags do happen because you’re paying not a big price for a TV like this which is feature loaded so I feel this is worth the Buy!,Picture quality is bad may be some defect,This is an Android TV in budget. It\\'s total value for money.. Not to best as compair with sony. But in this price the product is worth. Sound quality is not so good, but picture quality & smart features are very good.,Appears to be bad product and service. Within 9 months time my TV stopped working. Led panel stopped illuminating. Called many times for product service, technition came but no solution or response. Again made service request but since 30 days nobody is attending my complaint. Poor service from Amazon and one plus despite the product is under warranty??.,Premium look awesome picture quality,Unable to connect echo dot 3 😔Remote is also looking nice but main thing is that processing speed is slow.Sometimes Sony LIV and Zee5 app stuck.Rest given Chromecast and mobile share for OnePlus is nice facilities.Guys sound quality is not upto the mark.Rest in this price this okay.,Good,The offer, features, looks and price of the OnePlus Tv is so tempting you simply can\\'t resist buying. But once you buy it after a month the problems start it won\\'t switch on easily or will switch off like an app shuts down on your phone. It\\'s difficult to get your money back as obviously you can\\'t exchange it for another brand.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Delivery speed was great.Poor is an understatement for the quality of the product.It is slow, hangs every 5 mins, only way to get around it is to switch off and reboot, speakers are pretty average.Above all, watch the attached video. The video gets stuck and a cracking noise plays !! Reported and scheduled a return within 2 hours from the time of delivery.After using onplus phone, I was extremely impressed and ordered the tv based on my experience. After reading all the reviews here, I feel Onplus should simply take this product off the shelves if they care about their brand value.6th May : return scheduled on 4th May. No news yet on the pickup. :(Money will be refunded only after they receive the product.8th May : i called and Amazon promised to initiate \"advance refund\" if the product is not collected within 72 hours.12th May : I called Amazon customer service is now saying that they cannot process \"advance refund\" until they recieve the product.This is un-ethical customer service from Amazon. They lie to the customers.,Display gone within one month. Begging service engineer since a week after raising a request in Oneplus Service portal.I know it\\'s service teams negligence but problem is Oneplus is least bothered to resolve customer issues.,I have purchased the TV along with echo dot 4th generation. I was trying to add oneplus skill in Alex but TV was not getting discovered. I have called to oneplus support for the assistance but got mind blowing answer saying that due to some technical issue they have stopped the Alexa support and may be released in coming updated.Amazon and oneplus both are fooling the customers by selling the incompatibility device with wrong advertisement.After the issue with alexa, i have observed one more issue. I was not able to use internet even after my internet was working good. after going through multiple blogs, i found that there is some date and time issue.I have again raised the complaint with oneplus support. Engineer visited and made factory reset and left.I have called engineer, the issue is not resolved. The engineer has closed the service request saying that there is a problem with motherboard please raise the request again.I have raised again with engineers feedback and support team has said that they have escalated the issue to manager and will receive the call back in 24-48 Hrs, I have waited for 1 Week and again called up, same thing they said you will receive the call back in 24-48 Hrs and this time i have waited around  2 Weeks and called to support for status surprisingly they have closed the issue without resolution. asked the support person with what comment they have closed but he was hiding something and said that i don\\'t have access. again new issue request raised again.In short, Please don\\'t buy One plus TV\\'s and don\\'t fall for wrong advertisements of Amazon and One plus. These people are making the customers fools with name of brandRegards,Mahender,Even if you don\\'t budgeted for OnePlus TV if your price is 2-5k different, kindly go for this picture clarity and sound system is good. Great experience after lot if study and physical comparison in the showrooms. Has concluded in OnePlus. If you ask me 32 or 43, I\\'ll say 43 is the best. Installation done as per your request. Using the TV 4th month,Faulty product. Picture quality of tv is primary requirement which is quite bad. As the angle of viewing slightly changed, colour got faded. Technician comes with predetermined mindset. Doesn\\'t want to understand issue. By default product is Faulty. Replaced once but quality of picture is still faded. Thanks to Amazon that item returned and process for refund.,Never experienced like this from OnePlus Product earlier as i am fan and mad about the brand.but this product proved that oneplus is also doing the same gimmicks like others, slowly loosing their never settle tag.1. worst packaging damaged box, completely wet on wet2. TV has a lag will not response to the remote and even crashes and freezes sometime3. light bleed from the frame4. dark patches on the screen5. if your ceiling fan is running, forget about the TV output sound, worst output hard to hear.6. worst Amazon customer service no technical knowledge and always demand for pictures and disconnect the call.Amazon declined to replace and offered refund of 21150/- as against 23k which I paid for the TV after waiting for 45days and even brought pre book deal from Acko and cashback and alexa, customer service simply says product is not available for replacement cancel and take refund of 21150. never thought of writing a negative feedback on Oneplus, brand is loosing its value, I will strongly say Worst product from Oneplus and worst service from Amazon.,Amazon delivery very fast. Received next day but installation is cumbersome. The technician neither called me or came for installation on the scheduled day. When I called him, he will send someone for installation. I am watching the TV on table stand. Only drawback of the product is lag in every step. Picture quality is marvelous but sound quality is not clear and upto the mark. Considering the cost, the product is perfect.,After reviewed 1month I\\'m sharing this details , first impression is Voice recognise is working very quickly , and software updates got 1 time when time of unboxing Only, very light weight and good sound speakers , Wi-Fi receives good Singals strength , and very fastly moving through remote operates , android OS is not bad , Using OnePlus android app manage easily TV , Completely Awesome this Product .Cons:Using bluetooth headphone 🎧 connected to TV , sound is not good and something noise happening,I\\'m a big fan of OnePlus products and I was so happy when they announced the 32\" TV Y series. I pre ordered it on the first day itself. But later I\\'ve realised that it was the biggest mistake. The OnePlus trademark of quality doesn\\'t applicable on the this Y-Series. It feels like they have just put OnePlus logo on some cheap quality TV. I\\'m getting regular issues with the TV. If I claim for service the person comes and resets the TV and says everything it good and after 3-4 days same issue happens. 1st Issue: The screen went blank and only audio came without video. 2nd Issue: Video stuck and audio continues and remote doesn\\'t work. 3rd Issue: Sometimes Remote doesn\\'t work. 4th: There is some little gap in between the outside panel and the screen and when I showed it to the service person he says it is normal due to sensors present that gap is visible.but there is no sensor present in the middle. 5th: User interface sucks. 6th: Bluetooth connectivity issue. Multiple times I reported and the service person comes and resets the TV and leave.  7th: Connectivity b/w TV and remote is the worst. All the time the TV sucks. Do not go for it. If you want a 32\" TV in the budget go for MI or RealMe. OnePlus Y series is worst in the entire OnePlus lineup.,Picture quality is not good black is like brown and sound quality is very very poor I suggest you do not buy ☹️😞☹️😞,After installation and using one month I noticed that.there is a problem with the Android TV it\\'s automatically turned off. Some time its hang no function is working. I have to restart again. If you\\'re having a good budget then go ahead with the other brands this is my personal opinion but I find this TV is not reliable .,Sir , i have buyed it last few days in starting four to five days its working perfectly and now its gonna blur video quality and not happy with this product if company has send their executive to check it so its good otherwise it not a good and there is no customer support from this product also...sir i m trying to cl again and again but there is not a good response from their side.please pay attention regarding this and resolve this problem as the earliest.,Screen problem (disappears automatically)Sound problem ( not cleared)WiFi connection ( connection gone automatically nd shows no connectivity )Picture quality ( suddenly shows  Black nd white pictures)I suggest don\\'t buy it if u think it\\'s one+ tv 😞 disappointed so much,I brought this tv at the republic day sale and I regret taking this tv.Let me start with the good points about the tv- The sleek and Bazel less design.- User Interface is pretty good.Pain Points:- The installation experience has been pathetic and I in fact got it after a week of follow-up and complaint raising.- The tv is terribly slow - The booting of the TV takes a lot of time and Screen to Screen lag time is very high.- In the first week itself, The google assistant stopped working and I raised further complaints, the service guys then said that they will replace the remote but till now - No further response.- The colour and contrast combinations are pretty bad.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Full waste of money. Requesting everyone please do not buy one plus company TV . After buy my tv within one month screen automatically damaged and it will repair by one plus next two months and there customer care executives are always give u a fake promise. Attachment video for your reference,For buyers please read.....if you have already bought 43 inch is the only best thing that you have got.Design: SplendidResolution: Youtube can\\'t go above 1080pPerformance: Under fair not good. I dont get it 8k 9k mobiles get better config. why not TV. Another marketing gimmick.I love watching videos more in my laptop and thought getting TV will be a great time pass. Despite 1900 pix resolution, the youtube cant stream beyond 1080p. If you are looking for visual treat this is not it.,TVs reception from remote is awfull, half the time I am trying to change volume or any other settings I have to closer to the TV. The TV hangs so much while shifting from Netflix to Hotstar or any other channel. After using Oneplus mobiles for years I expected better from OnePlus.I am using NOKIA TV in same price range it is alot better.,Great TV for the price, Been using it for two months now, updates have seem to resolved some issues, yet the TV freezing up sometimes still persist, but on the contrary the picture quality is just amazing, if you have a decent internet or a hd setup-up box it\\'ll support dolby audio.,I\\'m happy with the tv, picture quality, sound quality and all the apps are great, if your getting this for someone who can\\'t use smart features don\\'t worry you can set default input on power on, and automatic power on when connected hdmi device is switched on.there are few things to note,1)you can\\'t log in with your one plus account.2)too much lag in screen mirroring (OnePlus connect), screen mirroring is working only with OnePlus smart phone.Screen cast work with all smart phones.3) don\\'t Get confused with the 50k tv , this one is not extremely slim, thickness is same as any TV you can get below 30k.,Very good tv . Picture clarity is superb. Sound quality isn\\'t too good. Will need to add a sound bar. Alexa dot doesn\\'t help in improving the sound quality. Instead using wireless bluetooth gives much better effect.,Please do not go for this productPoor sound quality,  average picture quality, very bad remote, worst of the worst operating system.Despite of reporting all this issues related to software and sound quality none of the oneplus support team bother to call back and respond to the query. Its been a month now almost I have been following up with support team , via email , calls, app , twitter.the only response I got is I will get back to you within 48 hours but till today nobody has got back to me with any response.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Actually I Bought the On Nov 13...and I Upgraded Normal setop Box To Hd settopBox after 5days...Since i Upgraded From normal to hdbox facing Those issue Screen Flickering,Lagging...Those and all...As I thought it would be becoz Of Weather problem As Nirav is Going And after few days Facing the same issue and i Kept service for settopbox they took the box for service and said there is nothing problem in the settop its Becoz of Tv...Problems facing of tv1.Hdmi port 1 screen flickering and lagging2.Hdmi port2 No Audio only VideoWhile we update apps on Playstore its keeps on Asking For agaian anad again4.ChromeCast lag..5.Its Keeps On Asking Retrieving Data When I Plugin Hdmi port 1..Since i kept for Replace they are saying return or replace window closed On 28 Nov...I am Just one day delay.I kept complaint on 30Nov And they are Saying Contact OneplusCare.....None Of the One plus Care Agent Contacted me And Assisting Me....living with a Fault Tv....Its Been 15 we Are Not Watching The TV...Veryy Bad Waste Of Money....I think Amazon Could Help me..My Concern is Provide Me A Replace...,I brought the TV during Amazon Prime Sale, I have never expected such a cheap product from such a good brand, TV lags all the time, sometimes you have to press the on/off button 3-4 times to start the TV. Don\\'t fall for the brand name, and If you really care about your moneh, stay away from Oneplus Tv.,It\\'s been a week since I Have been using OnePlus TV, 32 inch.Here is my observation:Price, I had a very good offer with my Amex points and sale from Amazon.Picture quality I would 3.5 -4Picture Sound, 3Voice recognition 3.5Weight, it\\'s just 3KG, very lite and hence very delicate.Boot process I felt bit slow, but manageable for an Android TV.Amazing Amazon Delivery and very quick installation. It appears for now a pretty smart buy for me.,I would have given ZERO STARS if that was an option.  Worst dealer.  I had my first TV replaced since the same stopped functioning after just a day.  When I got the replacement, that too faltered to deceive.  There was no display at all.  If Amazon ties up with such kind of dealers, it is to their own peril.THE PRODYCT MAY BE A GOOD ONE BECUASE I HAVEN\\'T WATCHED IT EVEN FOR ONE WHOLE DAY.BUT WORST DEALER AND WORST EXPERIENCE EVER ON AMAZON.PLEASE DON\\'T BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS DEALER.  HE MAY BE PUSHING SOME USED, FAULTY PIECES INTO MARKET.REQUEST AMAZON TO BLACK THIS DEALER.,It\\'s a good tv at this price..,Picture quality is OK.  Sound quality is pathetic.  For a 43\" TV, inbuilt speakers are substanard and sound is breaking.  Though they claim Dolby, there is no effect of Dolby. I have been using OnePlus mobile for the past several years.  Expecting same quality, I purchased their TV also but got totally disappointed.  Never expected such an experience from a reputed brand like OnePlus.,The television we got on 18th of this month.The installation team has not arrived to install my product and so I don\\'t know the picture or sound or remote control quality.The scheduled installation date was on 26th of September.I\\'ve called the Amazon team thrice. I got a number from the costomer care and I called several Times through out the day\\'s may be 30 plus Times. Once they attended the call and replied me that they will check and revert to me and then on no answering.So I\\'ll give this negative review.I\\'m really fed up with this product and since 10 day\\'s it\\'s in the box. And now I don\\'t want the crapy product.Vere vere very bad from the Amazon team.If the installation team has any problem they should respond to me. And I don\\'t think even the Amazon is taking proper action. Really bad.,No doubt Picture quality is really good but this TV has some issues. if You want a true review and complete details regarding cons then go and watch Techiebeez India Review of this TV on YouTube. Best channel for TV Reviews,Hardware specs are amazing for this product however the software is still in development. So sometimes it may not feel polished and some lags when opening or installing apps. Reboots helps reduce the lags, but until oneplus team manages better software you will be stuck with it. The good news is this is android so you may be able to install a custom rom for more polished experience.,It\\'s ok but not as good the sound is not good but picture quality is good and its operating system is bit slow,I\\'m purchase this TV march 12th delivered still running good but some times blootooth is not working properly and few days back automatically reset all settings....but picture quality is superb and,The television was delivered on time and installed by the team. However from the very next day we realised an issue that did not connect the tv to the internet directly and had to be set everytime it was switched on. 5 months, 5 technicians on, only response I hear is we are looking into. Absolutely disappointed with the service and product.,I can\\'t connect bloototh tv from my mobile.the Google assistant does not work.and the application oxygen play,one plus connect does not work.pls help me.otherwise I returned the TV .,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Bought this TV on 2nd march 2021 and by 16th march I could find that half of the  TV screen has got  blurred. You can refer the below screenshots.19- March-2021As soon as i found the issue, I have scheduled an appointment with the DIGICARE services and warranty.The service was scheduled to 23rd march but, the technician didn’t show up and left my calls unattended.23-March-2021Reached the Amazon service centre and they assured me to get the issue fixed by the end of the day but, they didn’t show up too.and now i’m still waiting for the Technician to resolve the issue.25-March-2021Technician reached me and inspected the tv for any physical damages, no damages found and he confirmed  that this is due to defective screen of the One+ TV.,I ordered a oneplus tv 43 inch. But i got a different model no. That alos I found after installation. Even installation team also not excale this issue. Then I request for the exchange.after 3 times of follow ups and 10 days after we got  replacement. And again we are awaiting another 2.days for installation person. Don\\'t know when it will be install. Surprisingly I want to tell u till we. Can\\'t check the model no of the TV. Once installation person will come then only we can get the clarity on this. So frnds be careful while receiving the product. Compare with ur order details and delivery product.,Excellent value for money product...everything works great. No issues at all till now. Ignore negative reviews, you will not get such a good product in this amount. I will probably buy the 43 inch as well.,Was excited about TV from OnePlus and was eager to buy one. Bought the OnePlus TV assuming that it would have certain quality standards. This TV turned out to be a bad purchase. Within 3 hours of watching the TV, noticed black patches in white screen across the panel. Have attached the pic. Called up AZ customer care and they confirmed that this is an issue.  This was my worst TV buying experience..pitchure quality was the worst ! Never OnePlus TV !,I bought this TV on a sale for 23k after applying bank discounts. Initially thought Oneplus would not compromise on the quality part but then after seeing the quality of the picture and smart features, I have to certainly change my mind. The so called android device is too slow and sometimes it just gets hanged. The quality of the picture is average and this was very disappointing from Oneplus. Overall an okay type TV.,Did not expected this from OnePlus!!!Reviewed in India on 18th May 2021Size name: 32 inchesProblems with OnePlus Tv 32Y1:(observed in few hours of use)Pros : 1. Picture quality is undoubtedly good.2.Sound is fine enough for a closed room.Cons :1. Lags too much .2. Some times restarts automatically .3. While watching YouTube screen and sound disappears for 2 to 3 secs.4.power on and off is also tricky.5. Some time disconnects from wifi and reconnect by its ownMaybe in later updates they provide some fix for all these issues.,Review after one week, product performance is average .. picture quality is good, but over all performce not as MI tv.Better go to MI ..,Memory is only 4 gbBefore finishing installation update for 1 gb was thereIn chromecast there is a delay in video with audioThere is slight delay in all the time,Being a hard-core OnePlus brand, it very hard to digest the worst quality TV supplied by OnePlus. The producy delivered to me is a faulty one with defective display pannel. It\\'s only showing lack of quality assurance by the brand which is known for providing quality products within the reach of common people. I hope OnePlus will seriously listen to these issue in future and take all the steps to recitlfy the problems in their system.,After a week\\'s analysis, I have placed an order for the OnePlus TV on Amazon. The delivery person was good enough to install and provided the Demo with very much patience. TV was working fine for that Day.!The problem started the next day. Though my home WiFi is connected to the TV, it is not allowing YouTube to play and not allowing my mobile casting. I have restarted TV many times and in vain.Later, I have complained to Amazon and they arranged a technician to my home and he agreed that there is an issue with the TV and suggested having a replacement.,In just 3 months of using, that screen started to get some lines, later in jus 5 days it went completely blank, seller is refusing to repair it in warrenty, very poor service by the seller. Will update the review if Amazon helps me resolve this issue. When things like this happen, you really lose faith in online purchasing of such items.,Amazon Delivery and product was excellent. My last TV was ordered from Flipkart and prior to that from Reliance digital. In both cases the technician was assigned within 30 minutes post Delivery. Here I had to wait for another day for installation which means I lost 2 days. Technician called and told me that I will have to remove the old wall mountable bracket myself as if he does it, that will waste his time. I had to call my contractor as I did not have the tools. Luckily I was at home. If my aged mother was alone she would panic. Never experienced such service in the past.,Worst sound quality, plus worst bluetooth, plus worst Chromecast, plus lagging and hanging issue, plus displays scan channel page without any reason.,Good but some issues .1. Remote sensor is not good.2 when connect with other device there is difference between audio& video.3.on & off automatically.4.sound quality is not good.But how much we expect in 13000/-,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I chosen the product keeping one plus mobile performance and reputation in mind but since the day the product delivered nothing matched with the quality.There was a free installation service with the product cart, but no one turned up till date.Sound quality and picture quality is not maching the compitition.Now hanging issue is increasing day by day. Don\\'t know what is fate of this product ahead.,I am reviewing this One plus Tv with various aspects after 25th day of usage.Picture quality : picture quality is quite good. Because it is full hd , the color in picture are very impressive.Sound: It comes with 20 watt dolby speakers. Very louder but not recommend to listen in full volumeSmart features: It comes with Android 9, with Pre installed Prime video, Netfix and youtube. Some time you tube crashes, talked to customer care, they said they are working on it.In nutshell it is satisfactory with this price range.,Bad TV ....Don\\'t go for it... you\\'ll regret...to switch on this TV the remote given is useless...not everytime you press the on button the TV will get switched on...it depends on the mood of the remote...it gets hanged also sometimes...voice quality is ok... Sometimes it gets quiet inaudible,I bought this TV on 11 Aug and it gets installed on 14 Aug. and TV was not connecting to WIFI at the time of installation. I logged a service request for the same and the problem is still not resolved even after 5 visits of technicians and more than 25 days.Just FYI I live in Delhi not any remote part of India.,Showing no connection  with buletooth  and wifi devices, poor built quality. The technician from also came and he suggested to replace this unit, but Customer care executive give me another appointment of technician. Why the replacement or return of item is not available  if the Customer is not satisfied ? After investing  money  more than other brands , this model of tv is not value for money.,After 2 weeks remote is not working,Connectivity features also not good. Inbuilt browser also not available.  Plz don\\'t buy it,  VU tv is better than oneplus.... installation was not done and didn\\'t respond... worst service. Sometimes remote not working,  suddenly getting back from the apps.,Its hardly 3 months that I have purchased the TV and there are already few problems with the software. When we press netflix it starts Youtube, sometimes the screen automatically blacks out while watching the TV.Seems one should always buys reputed brands only. Not worth buying even at lower prices. Waiting to see how they provide the after sales as its under warranty.,Just didn\\'t like the product as it is not working properly. This is the first time that I am really disappointed by Amazon and One plus but one time is enough. From now onwards Amazon will be the last resort to buy the things as well try to buy from showrooms or Flipkart. If something won\\'t be available somewhere then only will do business with Amazon.After being a Loyal customer for 7 years never expected that Amazon will treat me like this.Thanks for screwing up things.,Bought this product last year in July, from the start it had picture quality issues and the tv was very slow and laggy. In the first 2 months spots developed on the tv which resultef in changing the entire display for a new one. And now I\\'m having problems with the startup of the television, it is just showing the logo of 1plus and then switching off. Didn\\'t expect such a product from a trusted brand like OnePlus.,The main problem with it is not its speakers but the software support being given. Its software is very laggy and buggy with bugs which are never fixed. It might receive software updates but the bugs are still there every time. If you turn the tv off with remote, it turns on again on its own. Sometimes you have to press the power button several times to turn it on. If you switch between apps extensively it gets slowed down and lags till you restart it. Takes several seconds to power on.Overall, it has bad speakers and bad software. Display is good but you have to tweak it a bit because it is so saturated. So, spend some more money and don\\'t buy this product.,Did not expect from One plus. Worst experience ever. All of sudden video went into black and white and also one black lane was observed on the screen. Technician came and concluded that both back pannel and display got spolied.I raised a complaint and fighting with customer care (almost 2 months) and exchanging the mails (lot of drama happened) finally they replaced the new tv. Hope it goes few months. Can\\'t suggest you to buy this TV. Please think twice before you are going to buy.,Writing the reviews after 3 months of usage... TV on/off with the remote doesn\\'t happen in one shot.. TV gets crashed often... For tha last 4 days TV has become black and white. I have raised a compliant for which there is no proper response... And they are not ready to provide replacement as well... Need help from Amazon 🙏,with in 2 Month Wi Fi is not working TV restarting again and again .Service request logged on 16 April21 but still no one is attending this call.one False technician was allotted for this call but when I call to Technician He told That is not working with this company from Last 2 Month.I had mailed to one Plus customer care but nothing happed till date,Absolutly stunning.Oneplus did a great job.1. Picture quality : awesome , imersive.2. Sound is literallty more than enough for a large hall. Bass,sourround sound ,loudness and quality is just great. If you turn the volm. To max. , you are going to feel as if a large \"saadi wala dj\"  is in your room .3. Google assitant. , blutooh pairing , screen cast, all installed apps works seamlessly . No laging issues at all.4. Bezels are extremely thin . If you watch tv from a distance, you cant say even tv has bezels or not.5. Build quality is just great . Tv is very light weight .6 . One word review : best value for money, literally.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0First product receive. There was a line coming in the screen so tried for replacement.installation took three days. Tried for a replacement and again wait for 1 week to deliver,.product deliver now Waiting for installation 3 days already passed.Dont buy from. Amazon. They have worse installation facility and also they will take very much time. Instead go for sony. It is best instead of mi, one plus Or lg. Remote is not. Working. Faster if you use frequently,Performance is good, even it has a good clarity. I\\'m giving it 3 stars cuz of the poor service. I have been complaining since one month after the purchase of the product. It still has an issue with Wi-fi connectivity as well as bluetooth connectivity. It started just after a month of purchase and I have complained it for 3-4 time even still there is no response at all. Now it even has an issue with ethernet cable, ie. even after connecting ethernet cable it\\'s showing as no internet. It has such a poor customer service.,Worst, Must prefer Offline. Lot of hectic procedure. Also display was faculty. Picture gets blur anytime and it\\'s stuck for 3-5 secs.,First of all one star for Amazon not for tv from buying to installation every thing is pathetic .1. First if you want to buy this item u should have prime membership first condition2. After becoming the \"prime member\" TV is delivered after seven days it\\'s a joke from Amazon and it shows that  they don\\'t take their prime members  seriously3. And I have to wait for 10 Freaking days for insatallation4. Then that insatallation guy really he is a fraud he charged me 800 rupees for wall mount and before coming for installation he asked  there is two wall mount one is local of 400 rupees and another one is from one plus of  800 rupees so I choose the 800 one which is from one plus which is doubt full.5. One plus should add wall mount barcket in the box so these fraud installation guy can\\'t receive any one  after Amazon doesn\\'t take the liability of this they said that this is  the genuine price and I  doubt it because he didn\\'t bring the wall mount bracket in retail box and making excuse that he don\\'t have enough space in his bag .6. This is  the first time I am  buying anything from Amazon and I buy disappointem not a tv  from Amazon again thanks Amazon for this shipment experience .7. Now for tv is ok picture quality is decent but sound is not that great it\\'s loud but not clear .it could have been better connectivity is good just like everyone is saying that tv lags not in my case remote work superb no lags and everything else is ok,Bad product. No value for money,I have bought the TV on 19-Oct-2020 on Amazon Great Indian festival sale. And my honest comment is 1. Slowness while using Android and Chromecast. 2. Poor audio quality 3. When Wifi is switched on then tv automatically off and change from cable or antenna to android. So again we have to use the TV remote and change it back to cable.4. Youtube crashed some time so we have to switch off and switch on it again.,Good Product, Panel Quality and Sound is good, For the price it is worth. Smart functions can be bit overwhelming for some, but overall good experience. Android TV options are good. Even though YouTube may take but time to load and search. Still Highly recommend with my 10days only use.,The panel just went kaput, one fine day. Fortunately, during warranty period!Amazon took ages to even respond. Even escalation was handled poorly. Every Amazon agent only after getting good ratings , without any useful action.Brand responded in two days to depute a service person. More than a week later, One Plus says they do not have replacement parts in stock and DO NOT EVEN KNOW when they will be available.Typical Chinese product, buy at your own risk!!! In their association, even Amazon has got spoilt.,in this product One Plus 32\" Android LED, it is having problem when you see picture from other angle instead of straight, and it is not possible your all members can sit only infront of screen straight position only, when you will sit lightly side or side angle then colour will see fade.Same problem was in previous piece and I replaced this and new piece delivered on 27 April 2021 but same problem in this.I will recommend to all never buy this product because this is a manufacturer defect, and will lodge the compliant in my warranty, may be Amazon will help for correcting this.,Brought a TV.It worked for 21 days.And then the tv dsnt wana turn on.Never expected  this kind of thing from one plus.Very poor.Also the best part is they have many complaints like that coming for this model.Its so evident that knew there is some issue with this model of product and its  still its out for sale.And now i am being waiting for a tech to visit me from 2 days.Guys this is for any one who is buying this particular product.Plese please think twice.I dnt knw anything abt other product though this model of tv has some problems not worth the humiliation  and tension.,Have been using oneplus TV for more than 3 months now. Excellent purchase! Good picture quality, good audio output, great features! Since its android, you can install apps from built in google playstore app in the TV! I use an iPhone, no issues while casting mobile to TV screen.The only thing i dislike is that it sometimes glitches while switching between apps. Hope OnePlus fixes it soon with updates. An excellent TV in this price range. Go for it!,Changing my review after 2 months,Firstly, it does not start normally as you have to wait for a whileSecondly, after it starts, it goes to home screen by its ownAlso, Poor display and sound quality.... Cheap panel and its not OnePlus brand quality.. Moreover, its remote stopped working now 😡,Writing a review after 2 months. It’s working absolutely fine. Picture quality is good and it’s a perfect buy in the price. I tried to connect on 5G but didn’t happen but 2G also works great so I didn’t bother to call the technician. Installation was quick and paid only for wall mounting which was around 200.,The system hangs and gets turned off itself, I am tired of complaining about the product and have filed the complain thrice and there is no response from the service team, they have disappointed and ruined my experience from buying the product from amazon and one plus products. I am never going to recommend one plus products anymore to anyone. On the first visit, technician asked to visit make a video when it gets turned and talked with inappropriate manner. It\\'s my third complaint so far and they have ruined my experience.,Few functions are not working. Had so much expectation from One plus like brand.

Remote sensor is at right bottom of tv . so everytym tym u want to operate using remote . u have to point ur remote there. this is painful. Sound quality is ok but volume is less.oneplus software is ok . decent . but it is little laggy. overall for this price it is ok but there are quite some issues which needs to be fixed in this TV. i would say avg product.Not so great . not so bad either.,Yes the tv is too goodPositive1.Good picture clarity2.power saving3.cheap price4.chromecastNegative1. Very delicate body2.suitable for wall mount and preferred for table mount3.No sound clarity4.remote is not accurate and provide a good quality remote,Never going to order anything from amazon. Terrible service. Tv stopped working within 15 days, and asked for support. The support didnt show up and it said service completed. And now it says service not available. We are unable to watch the tv from 2 months. Amazon didnt give any support from 2 months. Customer care keep on saying they will fix in 2 days but dont do anything. Tried amazon for the first time and was terribly disappointed. Dont buy this. Go use flipkart. NEVER USING AMAZON EVER,WITHIN 6 MONTHS WE BOOKED CUSTOMER SERVICE 2 TIMES AND FACING ISSUES FREQUENTLY.After 3 months it was automatically restarting and not connected with wifi. Then customer service fixed that.Again after 2 months it was not connected with wifi and not sync with remote.If we call the customer service, it will take 5 business days to visit our home.Very bad experience.,I was skeptical at first because of the negative reviews regarding the sound quality, but after tinkering with a few settings I managed to increase the volume. The TV has amazing picture quality and sound quality is way better the previous tv I owned.,First product had wifi connection problem. I had to connect to mobile hotspot first before connection to home WiFi is established. Technician told me to replace item. The replaced product also had WiFi issue. Tv time needed to be set correctly every time tv is started. Oneplus technician told there is software issue and they are waiting for next update. I can\\'t rely on that. Returned second item as well. I\\'m getting some other brand now.Otherwise tv seemed fine when I was able to play it.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0The product seems like something picked from a Chinese container and stamped with you OnePlus branding. The wlan doesn\\'t work in the TV and even after numerous attempts haven\\'t been able to the Amazon installation team. Seems they are so uneducated about the product that they are not able to understand the problem. Or maybe they don\\'t want to, poor product from the OnePlus saddle.,After a month of usage1. Switch ON TV takes 3-4 seconds post pressing Power button over Remote. Clear indication or LAG !2. While using DTH, have to use 2 remotes (OnePlus TV remote to Switch ON/Off, increase/decrease volume and Airtel DTH remote). Don\\'t know if it\\'s how the OnePlus TV remote is designed that it won\\'t sync with Airtel DTH remote or something else !3. Sometimes there\\'s no sound while TV is switched ON while on DTH. To fix it, I restart TV and it works. Not sure if it\\'s the software issue for Live TV or issue with DTH set-top box configuration !,I bought this for my bedroom. For this price its ok. Finishing of the TV is bad. The edges look odd. Picture quality is good, sound is definitely not good, its loud but not good. TV got delivered within 3 days and was installed at the time of delivery.,I ordered the tv . It\\'s a good tv at this price range. After receiving the tv Amazon is unable to Install it because of their technical problem. I wait for some days for their suggestion. But they failed to provide me support. That\\'s why I returned it.,This TV also not working with Alexa. Amazon provide wrong information. Both Tv  i have 32\" & 43\"  both tv not working with Alexa.  I request to Amazone please don\\'t provide wrong. 10-15 time i called customer care they also not provide any solution regarding this issue. 2 time they sent technician and they also faild to connect Alexa with TV. And the major thing is Technician don\\'t knw how to connect Alexa. Both time they came and check only Tv.,The product received was in good condition, amazon delivery is awesome. But the performance of the TV is not satisfactory, I am facing a technical issue with the television & the colours are too bright for a normal eye. The remote & Television connection is bad, takes a long time to switch on/off & change the channels. 2*,I am not sure if the customer care even exist for one plus Y series, tried reaching them twice but no luck. The first time they closed the request stating I was not reachable, second time no call so far. Not sure if it\\'s me who is facing the issue or if anyone else please do highlight. My suggestion do not go for this brand when you the likes or sony and LG and others.,Delivered and installed on Saturday October 30th. It was working fine on that day. Second day morning when switched on the entire display turned into pink. And it happened on the third day as well. Had to switch off and then switch on the TV again to make it work properly everytime. Didn\\'t expect this for a 26k TV and from oneplus. Do consider before buying this. Have requested for a inspection and replacement. Let\\'s see how Amazon deal with this issue.,OVERALL THE BESTBUT BEING A ONE PLUS USERI HAVE TO TELL THAT THE SIZE OF PRODUCT IS A LITTLE LESS THAN 43 INCHES AND SPEAKER QUALITY IS GREAT BUT WHILE USING NETFLIX WE HAVE TO INCREASE THE VOLUME ABOVE 70%,Pros:Good picture qualitySatisfactory Sound qualityUser InterfaceCons:No 5G Wifi band connectionLags in User interfaceMost of all, pathetic after sales serviceHaving mentioned all that, god forbid if your device needs a repair amazon and oneplus will take forever to resolve that. Even if your device is in warrenty and requires a part change you will have to wait for 1-2 months to get it resolved.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I bought this product 8 months back but the display became faulty. Don\\'t buy this product.,1. Diaplay - Very impressive2. Sound  -  Ultimately clarity.. No need external speaker for home.. Its more enough3. Connectivity - Easy to connect to internet & Access through one plus app to TV.Value for money.. One thing i recommended to buy DTH HD connection..This is for my one week experience,Useless product. If you’re remote conks then no replacement available even if you want to pay and buy. onePlus keeps saying that they don’t have it in stock so buy at your own risk.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0The TV is overall perfect picture quality and sound. The only question over here is of reliability, i bought this tv on 30 September but facing problems with it since then and when i raise a complaint it starts working fine automatically. And magically it occurs again after 1 month.Faced the issue again last week and this time the issue still existed when the service person came.Please see the video attached and decide. This video was taken by the service technician that visited. Overall i rate this TV 1 star because if reliability.,Dont buy this tm if you are looking for good display.i connected this to my laptop and the quality of the display is so bad.you can clearly see pixel and it is blurr.its only good for sound and app feature.. not for display,TV Not working from Day Two Onward, contacted One Plus Through Amazon for  Service no Res ponce from Company Side and Amazon side also , Finally They Cancelled Service RequestTV with me but not working, waste of MoneyDon\\'t Buy,I had a lot of expectations, but iam disappointed. The picture and sound quality is good. But the software is very very very bad. Maybe because it\\'s just 1 GB ram.It\\'s gets stuck intermittently. It gets shutdown on its own. It keeps coming out of the apps like YouTube on its own,Tv display is damaged in 15 day, i can understand in machinary it happen but after one month brand is not repair it. this is the concern.  I have reached to Amazon they also not helped and say we are not responsible brand will give resolution on this. I am waiting waiting and waiting. when techinician will can and repair. If it will not resolved in next 10 days then last option is Consumer court.,Remote is not working properlyPoor Picture QualityWorst Soundan entry level TV where you don\\'t mind quality. never expected worst product form company like ONE Plus,Do not buy this product as it\\'s quality is worst.There are bugs (small insects, ants) entering into the display and roaming freely inside it. Please see the picture I attached with this review.I am trying to contact customer care for last 3 days but no reply from their side as well. I feel like i have wasted 13000 on this product.,Worst ever....after 10 days of purchase , TV is not starting, raised issue in amazon and they denied service , raised to 1+ ,they are also making excuses since complaint raised. Still counting days and no one has shoen up till now.....more than a month passed since complaint raised.,Picture quality was goodSoftware running smoothlyLike it very muchBut within a day display started problems like flickering white,May be I got defective product I think so I returned it,I bought the TV on October 15 and intalled on 25th October..But, On December 18th. The TV showed display error and i requested a service via amazon. But literally there was no response form them for these three days,It has everything to offer in this price range, but the only issue i see in the device is it is slow something that I can\\'t even change the application or go back to the menu again...But that occurs like  1 or 2 times a day.. other than that i guess its a very nice product in this price range.,Tv was very good in terms of picture quality. Sound is manageable to some extent. Internal featutes and wifi everything works pretty good. In remote two of the buttons were not functioning but voice wise it is able to recognize but, tv is quite lacking.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0My opinion is to not buy this tv why because.. I have faced an issue with the wifi connection as it disconnects automatically as shown in the video. I have changed it once under warranty but after a couple of weeks the issue still exists.. So go for MI or Realme smart tvs. Oneplus is lacking in their quality and services. If you have any other go to sell the product please go ahead and buy something useful.,Two Conditions faced in last 10 days1. Wifi connection in TV is not stable, same wifi in other TV and devices won\\'t give problem. However in 1plus TV it keeps on disconnecting.2. Often shows home screen without pressing any button on remote while binging shows over internet,Good,Tv was not what was shown in the description. Whole plastic body was looking very cheap, besides the rate was also cheap, but at first i thought one plus would not deliver cheap product even at cheap price, but i was proved wrong.I returned the tv as there was some technical issue where tv was showing blue screen when turned on after few hours in standby mode, and only solution was to turn it off completely and then again turn on, so finally i decided to get rid of the tv and as there was no replacement available i got a refund.,Writing this review after 10 months. Don\\'t buy this tv. The quality for display is very poor. I\\'m using oneplus and vu tvs. When comparing with oneplus, VU tv\\'s display quality is far far better. And I got bright and dark spots in display after 10 months of usage. I\\'ve called for service it is more than a week, but no response from the service team. There are still asking for more time. Better go for VU.,Don\\'t Bought this onle plus  TV .Some features are not working ( mobile mirror, voice assistance) so i have sent replace request after that replacement i got defect /damage product refer enclosed pic.. Now a days amzon selling worst product i am experience few products recently 😔,I ordered this during the festival sale. This product was delivered and installed on time. Coming to the product the HDMI ports were not working properly. One port wasn\\'t working at all and I was seeing a pinkish screen on the other port. Amazon didn\\'t let me replace the tv and I had to reorder the tv at ₹ 1000 higher price than before. The new tv was delivered after more than 10 days.  And the installation date provide was one week after that. So for getting a working tv I had to wait for 24-25 days. The service provided by amazon during this festival sale was no where near the mark set up by them previously.,Product was very good but had worst blasting speakers.. one plus does not have good customer service for TV. Since it was manufacturing defect Amazon took return. Else one plus customer service was non existent. Learnt a big lesson. Better to spend 1k more and go for Samsung,Poor Quality TV at low cost.Poor display.Poor sound quality.Extremely slow procesor.You can not see the TV for long time.Not a eye friendly.Delivered with damage display.Returned the same.Amazon should stop selling poor quality product to maintain their quality standard.,OnePlus has rolled out a perfect TV , like it\\'s phones. Good picture quality, display, UI and remote. Direct option to switch to youtube, Netflix , primevideo. The Google assistant works perfectlyNeed bit improvement in sound quality.Best pacy in least price,It is One Plus! No need to write anything. Picture quality is good. Everything is good. It comes with android. You will never get this type of product in this prise tag! I\\'m making this statement after through market research.But internal video player could be better. It never resumes your playback!Overall Im fully satisfied and happy with my decision.,Picture quality is okayish.No 5ghz connection support.Audio quality is so poor that you may want to return the tv back.Installation is poorly done by 3rd party service & costs 400/- for wall mounting.I would suggest to add some more money and go for Samsung, Sony or Panasonic.Don\\'t get tempted by price.Poor quality from oneplus, didn\\'t expected that.,From the starting itself  i.e  from April 2021 it started showing problem with light and some time hanging problem. Now no picture is visible. Only sound Please send service engineer to repair it immediately,My overall experience with the product for 2 days, it\\'s very bad. Tv is not working properly. Remote doesn\\'t work and you can\\'t do anything about it. Picture quality is very poor. You won\\'t get REPLACEMENT from amazon. Shell out extra 3K and purchase from reputed brands, never ever dream to go for OnePlus. Be cautious, you will not get any product support from amazon and you have to live with a defective product. Visit a nearby showroom and purchase from them..this is what I wish to do right now :( after living with a defective product. Atleast you don\\'t need to worry about after sales support.,The product is good.. but there are few bugs in oxygen play. Every time you have to pair Bluetooth speaker to connect, which is annoying! You are in unpair- pair device loop often.The picture quality and perfomance is best in class. The software experience is seamless. I am expecting these minor bug fixes in software update.,One of the best lcd tv at this price range.Update on my after sales support: it is the worst after sales support that I ever experienced compared to other brands during pandemic. Took almost 1.5 months to get my panel replaced.,The Tv is really impressive in all aspects, haven’t tried the voice recognition and other smart features because it has just arrived. Happy with the delivery within two days of placing the order. Butter service by the providers are pathetic. The scheduled installation date was fixed but nobody came for the installation. Though I don’t need installation etc but just wanted to know the service but I am really very disappointed with the service by the service providers,This is the slowest TV I ever used.Don\\'t waste your money.Pathetic display clarity.Remote functions are dead slow.Amazon refused to offer HDFC cash back.Contacted many times. Amazon Agents are irresponsible and still it is pending.,Really worst service from one plus, I have purchased just 2 months before, it\\'s always internet connectivity issue, I logged a complaint 20 days before but still issue not sorted. Still saying we will come and we will resolve.Really I was not expecting this kind of support from oneplus, it has failed in television catagory,This is the worst smart tv that would be available in the market, with just Netflix Hotstar and YouTube installed the tv hangs. Takes ages to switch from one app to another.Picture and sound quality is poor.Remote stops working and the TV needs to be restarted to pair the remote again.,I am using this TV since two weeks .My honest review -One of the best picture quality and good designed like premium looks.I could see may reviews about sounds quality. My personal experience is sound is  so good .. it was clear and there is no any noise.The one part i faced the issue is  screen mirroring it was very bad ..I unable to connect screen mirror with one plus connect application.I am connecting through 3 party app.,Into one month everuthing was working fine... But now the HDMI port got compliant... It take 2days for amazon to arrange technician to come.. After that its now 5days... Till now waiting for spare parts to come....Hope everything will be covered by warranty....Edit 1.Its nov 10th still tv is not repaired... Even amzon customer care people dnt knw what to do with this warranty...Please dont buy this tv.....,I Purchased the product last month in Diwali sale and overall I am satisfied with the product quality. But in comparison to the other brand\\'s like MI,  Realme etc price is on the little higher side, If the rice is a little bit lower side it will be a higher selling product.,I\\'m received this TV on 27th june today is 3rd July still the installation team didn\\'t came I have only 4 more days to make replace(if any issues), on my schedule date that technician called me asking for money for installation, here they mentioned free of installation, next schedule is showing for 7th June and that is the last date to replacing option for this TV try to change the process otherwise please stop your brand,Best in this price range .we can expect moreI am using since 10 of july undoubtedly picture quality is too good sound is also good as compare to other brands.There is an issue while opening any app, i think it will get optimized after next update  that they are providing in September.,I am a Prime customer and usually order all my electronics and other stuff from Amazon and I am happy with the services. One Plus Y series was a Nice Deal but during the order there was no clear guidelines for Amazon Eco Dot offer and I ordered as per the details mentioned there but I did not get Eco Dot and I contacted customer care but they were also not able to get me the offer. I am a Prime customer but disappointed with my experience with this order. I have read the terms and conditions during that time and it was not present and later on added by seller or Amazon.,The screen cast is not supported by the TV.It\\'s been 2months for the TV and the display started to flicker with a black line vertically on the display.Further the repair/ return service against the warranty is not very customer friendly, I\\'ve been trying to avail the warranty service but no positive response received from the other side.,Better options are available. This tv is called smart tv but cannot connect to 5g and can\\'t mirror cast freely.  You will have to buy google chrome cast for the same.,Will recommend don\\'t buy smart tv from amazon at least, coz the worst product and service anyone can get from amazon will be this. Within one month the product stopped working and not getting any help from amazon. Just pathetic service and faulty product.,I would suggest please dont but oneplus tv which is terrible in terms of usage...I am using from the last 7 months and it got repair issue twice and service takes uptown 1 month to repair the TV ...worst product I have ever seen in my life ...please dont buy from Amazon as well....,I never expected to write a negative review for OnePlus Product!I love OnePlus but I hate that TV because poor build quality.1. White edges on bottom of Tv and Screen Flickering is the most common problem2. Half of the times, TV doesn\\'t start with a single button press.3. Booting takes atleast 20 seconds4. Screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time.6. System lag is the maximum in this class of TV\\'s,Echo dot doesnt work with the TV as advertised and is awaiting a software update so buying an echodot as a bundled offer with the One Plus TV is not helping . The TVs picture quality can be a bit better and really not upto the Mark as it is advertised. The TV apps is a bit slow and hangs at times . The Remote functioning is not as agile comparing a VU or any typical brand . Overall not a pleasant experience and  not expected from One Plus. I have a feeling Oneplus is compromising on the quality at various ends .,Nice product at this price. Quality of picture is very nice. Has got all the smart features. Voice recognition is also good. For that make sure your internet is has good singnal. Sound quality is not good. For that you have to buy sound bar. I am giving this review after a month. As if now I have not got any issue yet. But at this price I will recommend to buy OnePlus TV,Gap between frame and screen. Disappointing1. Sound quality is very bad2. Build quality is very bad,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0There is no doubt about picture quality it\\'s one plus product..Just go for it..after Apple one plus is the only company has most trustable about quality and performance...I am planning to buy another one on next sale...,Picture quality is good. Issues with sound quality, but on customizing the sound from settings, the sound quality improves a lot. At this price point, it is quite good. If one is happy using YouTube, AmazonPrime, Netflix, which are pre installed, you are not going to face any issues of lag.Most importantly, found \"Made in India\" written on the back panel of the TV. So, one can prefer this product from other available at same price range.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Product is good but pictury quality is not as expected.I feel MI smart tv picture quality is better than this OnePlus Tv (my opinion because some people feel that OnePlus tv picture quality is better than MI tv). Connectivity is good. It runs android 9 with built in playstore.,One of the best Smart TVs out there. It isn\\'t 4K but no compromise in the picture quality whatsoever. Just a little bit slow, but again, at this price point, and other features (the remote is great, and voice recognition and Google assistant works great), it can be ignorable. Also the sound quality is enough to fill a decent hall. Chromecast and pairing devices are really smooth.,I seriously recommend you not to purchase one plus products TV, in 20 days it got problem with blank screen and flickering, from last 3months I am behind customer care and service centre guys. No one till the day is responding  and even after more than 30 mails sent to support team. OnePlus is not supporting any tv which is purchased fron Amazon as they said.,Sound quality needs to be improved.. and you can use HD only less than 1TB which is major disadvantage. Any USB device more than 1TB will not work.Good installation team..supportive & helpful.,It has very great picture quality, rich sound, and all of the smart features available in present. It also has support for voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, you can assign commands through your voice.The TV runs on Android TV 9.0 operating system, so apart from regular content, you can stream content directly from other online platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime and YouTube.,It is a china product. Material and voice is worst than kids toy. It hangs after 15 days....  Worst support for claim.... Support team only wasting time... Warraty repair request automitically finished without service...  I m going to wait for a week otherwise going to throw this into dustbinToday on 15 decAmazon person telling that service to be provided by company and company technician without any service without clearing claim finished the claim... Ridiculous,I bought this product because all my family members have 1 plus phones...but was very disappointed with the remote control...the sensor is very poor..i have to literally get up each time and go close to the tv about 10cms apart and use the remote... which is really irritating.. they should work on this issue,Product of one plus 43” Tv was good But the customer service is worst of Amazon if you buy a tv in Amazon the installation will done for year or more days it will take and then they tell us to do installation of our nearby technician they tell us to give money to them we will pay you in Amazon pay balance but also they doesn’t pay and they always tell us update in 48 hours something up to now it happened one month so I tell you to don’t buy in Amazon,Facing many lagsSound(voice is low, back ground voices noisy nd  disturbing) while watching any showsDisplay little FlickeringPicture more saturatedRemote connectivity slowSuddenly it\\'s restartsVery laggyMany bugsOne plus(waste)I ordered product aug 14.. But untill now no installation ..installation team will escape ny saying false statements.So finally after 20 days i got installation by my own.. amazon will provide money for installation just 500(amazon pay balance)No proper response from amazonBetter go for high end models,Sometimes apps or programs is strucking. It will take time or we will switch off the TV to restart. App will not not close automatically if another app is running. Some disappointed,All features are good, 15 days remaining for my device warranty and its display is gets black. worst experience with OnePlus, I brought this device because I am using OnePlus 7 pro Mobile. I it\\'s customers service not even pick up my call.Very disappointed.,Everything is fine at this price i believe you cannot get a good brand and this quality. Its just tv lags a bit but it is negligible. At this price it is the best tv and picture plus sound quality is too good!,Its a good tv for its price but there are some smart features are not there one of the example is there is no browser on the tv the customer needs to add it a different way or pay for it…. Etc but otherwise its good tv,Worst ever experience with one plus 🤦🏻\\u200d♂️ Couldn’t pair my iPhone with chrome cast ! Very second day the display issue popped up ! Contacted amazon for replacement and they said not possible ! Bought it on emi and returning the Tv now. Lost money on emi conversation charges and GST amount by bank! Amazon never cares ! Flipkart is better than amazon on customer experience! Defective products ! Worse customer experience with most customer eccentric company on earth !,This tv 📺 is perfect and one plus doesn’t need any marketing stunt and this tv price is perfect compare to other tv brands and picture quality is perfect 🤩And yes Sony Bravia also comes close to this but I would like to go with one plus value for money  😊,nice at this rate > >TV\\'s pixel\\'s are dead, >audio quality is not good it is loud, >it does not have Miracast we have to cast our phone screen with help of Google home. and> the most irritating thing is \"speed\" of TV it\\'s very slow obviously it have Bluetooth remote but sometimes TV response very lately . I was not expecting this.but overall it\\'s fine.\"I will prefer you to buy MI TV instead of OnePlus TV!!\"Thanks,Product is good but installetion service is very very bad,anybody not call me.I called several times to instslletion technition he did not respond.finally I installed my tv through local technition.DONT BUY PRODUCT FROM AMAZON.SERVICE NOT GOOD.,TV takes a while to start without anything displaying on tv, so it becomes really tricky as you wouldn\\'t know if tv is turning on or not.The picture quality is very good for the price.Voice recognition is also slow at time it misses your first word.,Osm,If you want to waste your money then buy this tv, I had also bought thinking of OnePlus brand value.But this tv can\\'t even connect to wifi and if it gets connected miraculosly, it will automatically disconnect after 10 or 15 minutes. OnePlus should drop the name smart tv as it cannot even connect to wifi. So I returned it.Don\\'t go only by brand name. OnePlus don\\'t have any experience in making TV\\'s. So avoid oneplus TV\\'s, look for alternative brands.,Just perfect, no description needed. I really liked the tv though I expected more from OnePlus but as it comes for 16000rs it is just perfect. The features are good, picture quality is decent, sound is awesome that comes with dolby atmos and the remote is bluetooth configured which is very nice. If you are willing to buy a 32 inches smart tv, this is the best option you can go for it.,Simple trick to hang the TV.Play any vedio on YouTube.Off the TV frm remote.On the TV frm remote.The OnePlus Y series TV get hang, noting works unless you unplugged and plugged in again.Plz try with your One Plus Y series TV and share your feed back.The TV software is not properly tested and launch in Market. Some time screen get blur, only volumes come and pictures get hang.It takes 10 to 15 sec to start.Waiting for any Upgraded patch from OnePlus expecting to be fixed with software upgrade.Picture and sound quality is good.,Good to watch movies in in tv .I bought an 43 inch tv at price of 25k. Only draw back is sometimes is becomes slow or screen gets a lag and it came back to home screen.,No wall mount attached to this TV. Bad installation experience,Worst product .. dont buy this one .i know its very cheap but plz dont waste your money . Its been the 1st night my remote is not being able to switch on the tv ...it lags/hangsup many times a day sound quality is worst.. go for any other brand  but not one plus .. never expected this third grade quality product. There\\'s even a colour fluctuation while playing the video sometime and its not even two days..,You will get what you pay for, i had high hopes at first and ordered it through amazon.The installation service by one plus is satisfactory but the television is where it all spills, it will work properly for the first couple of months and then the experience gets really laggy.The contrast is really bad and the sound quality is average.It is a one time investment, please go for sony or Samsung by spending more but dont buy this.2 stars out of 5.,Worst tv worst customer service my tv stopped working with in two days due to some software issue service centre people also very unprofessional and Dehradun service centre have no knowledge about tv softaware they are failed to resolve the issue which is still pending.,please dnt buy .. i am giving this review after using it for 6 months but i am facing the issues from day one the tv hangs all the time and its really slow .. when i asked amazon to fix it i was told by the technician the system will update in few days and after that is will work properly .. after updating it twice its same .. dnt your waste money i thought its one plus brand so i bought it but regretting now ..,SOUND -: The most disliked thing is the sound of Y serie and one more thing is the speaker comes without tweeter ,its like local speakers voice.PICTURE QUALITY-: Good  ( 4.0of 5.0)Value for money -: this comes for the ones budget under 25k.Oneplus connect - is a lit bit laggyFull plastic body not a even metal used in the body,I bought this television October 2020 within one year suddenly display dissapered that\\'s ok it in warranty so I want to replace it but the worst part which is I dint expect from one plus is very worst service for television it\\'s been 2months till now no repair just calling up customer service still they will never get back to me my serious recommendation is not to go for one plus TV and I will end,Tv looks premium and slim and very light weight.Voice it low than usual . Inbuilt speaker is too low even for small room . You need to use extra Bluetooth speaker . But what else you expect in this price. I got this in 12k which is serving purpose overall.,I am not at all satisfied with the picture quality. also there is a fault in the remote. not at all happy with the product. The TV installation person came when the return window was closed. This is not expected from Amazon. this is disgusting I want to return this product.,Do not buy this product the dealer is delieviring old items from the godown, i have purchased one it it\\'s display is scratched. When i call amazon customer help they denied to replace item and call me that you have to check when item is delievered, that was so minor how can we confirm in once. Please by from the local shops istead of amazon.,The product was amazing...picture quality was so good,sound quality of the tv is good.But the tv not connecting with the mobile and Google assistant is of no use and it\\'s not connecting to the device. The wall mount was not given with the tv..the technician is worst..he does not gave complete information about the tv.. the technician doesn\\'t know anything...I need abetter demo so plz send another technician.. thank you,I have had this tv for nearly 5-6 months now. And I’ve had a horrible experience. Neither the quality nor the software is acceptable. There is so much lag everytime I switch on the TV or open an app. Highly recommended not to waste your money and time on this.,Picture quality is not good not bad, hangs up while switching apps, blank black screen while opening apps , sound lag while connect to blue tooth speak or Alex blue tooth heeps disconnect and re connect it\\'s self while tv is ideal in 1 minute atleast 10 times. One plus  1 ➕ should thing while launching products under budget.,There is a problem in software bcz when it on , i see some lagging problem there. oneplus connect is not supporting properly.

Half of the times, TV doesn\\'t start with a single button press.3. Booting takes atleast 20 seconds4. Screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time.5. Audio is dud - Not sufficient for my 10X10 ft bedroom6. System lag is the maximum in this class of TV\\'sEdit: 23/07/2020Amazon declined to replace and offered refund of 19,600/- as against 23k which I paid for the TV. All I have to do now is to live with a defective TV, as I had invested in the wallmount and the allied services. OnePlus SettledEdit: 27/07/2020Product is back in stock. Amazon accepted for replacement after technician report. But, defective product is yet to be picked up and the replacement is yet to be shipped. Awaiting further details. Brand is not at all acting in the customers interest. Very bad response for OnePlus.Edit: 6/8/2020Received the replacement TV from Amazon and the TV if working fine as of now. I installed it on the wall by myself. A bit of lag and sound issues, but the screen stuttering is gone.,TV is beautiful with minute bezels.I was pleased by the picture quality in firstI expected a smooth software from oneplus but TV operation is bit slow probably due to 1gb ram and lower clocked processor. Can\\'t complaint at this price point. Wish oneplus would release better optimized software in update. Software update was one of my reason to buy TV from oneplus.Response from the bluetooth remote was bit slow.But hold bluetooth was very functional. Might be as it is bluetooth 5.0, TV was able to connect to 3+ devices at a time. 1 mobile, 1 bluetooth speaker and remote. That\\'s great.Coming to sound, Speaker quality isn\\'t upto mark. You have multiple options to enhance audio (dolby, surround, presets, dialogue enhancer etc) probably that\\'s the reason oneplus skipped 3.5mm output and opted for optical and HDMI ARC ports to provide quality auido output on external speaker. You should go RCA audio adapters if you want 3.5mm input else connect to speakers using bluetooth adapter. That would cost additional if you want to.If you look for picture quality, minimal design and stick to few ott app this TV is for you.For power users and those who use only 3.5 jack to connect speakers look else where.Update :Oneplus released major update and UI and remote control navigation seems improved now.But setup of new Bluetooth connection got buggy. Im not able to connect to new devices. It is looping back to searching devices after clicking on device after search list,ere is my experience with the Oneplus LAGGY tv32Y model.\\u2028Here is a list of issues with your product.1. connected to Samsung mobile through google home as the tv isn\\'t connecting through Samsung smart view. always says unable to connect, try again. And even through the google home, it is struggling too much to even cast the photos and forget about casting the videos.2. Neither windows nor Mac is recognising The tv in wireless mode. Had to use third party app from play store to Airplay my Mac n gues what, windows is not recognising the tv. It is really shocking to see Mac recognised where Windows couldn’t (using third party play store app).3. To my bad, even through third party play store app, it is laggy half of the times.4. And how can I ignore to say about Oneplus connect app, Its a wonders**t app, do the gesture wait for couple of seconds and then it responds and you can’t access files through the connect app on this tv.5. And sound, it has options by the name, dolby Audio and Dolby digital plus, fix this in your mind, these two features are just names and these does change the sound experience by zero percentage.6. On Youtube, video quality is limited to 1080p, best to use HDMi cable to your happy and play 4K, only then it felt better than any other video quality experience of this tv.7. Opening and closing apps, is like suspense thriller movie scene experience, you will be waiting to know when it will respond.sometimes suspense extends to 3-10 seconds.8. Viewing angles? acceptable for this price.9. Colors? Green is worst of all and then red , black is good, blue colors are worst, yellows are good and the rest that you find are acceptable.10. Display quality? If any of you ever used the Chinese phones of the last decade, you will get the exact same feeling. I promise you this.11. Best option to put  good use of display and colors is to use pen drive, hard disk or HDMI and play the 4k or full HD videos. This is the only way that this display can make you happy.12. And the remote, the menu button literally never worked on  any app nor on home page. It just exists with void function assigned to it.13. Almost forgot about voice search that is google assistance, 10 out of 10 times, it took 3-10 seconds to launch it.14. Opening an app, Fix in your mind that it will take at least 3-10.15. Once you connect Bluetooth accessory, you have to remove the device from the list, if you want to connect it to other device. you will not have an option to disconnect.,I will be brief here.Unboxing:No wall Mount.No Display cables.Plastic stands.Thin TV.Pros:Contrast Ratio is Amazing. Black level is amazing.Viewing angles r fine.Awesome Colour accuracy.Latest Android version.Cons:Poor quality Speakers.Little bit laggy, probably the OS.The panel is awesome, TV won’t lag when playing video, and it’s really okay, android phones have similar issues.As for speakers, why would you use inbuilt speakers?What matters most is Contrast Ratio, Colour range, viewing angles, and clarity.They r all good in this price range, no 20k-35k 43” FULL HD TV could do better.AMAZON INSTALLATION:I didn’t get the wall mount, cause installation guys were charging me for it!TV is good, Amazon Service is getting poorer.,After 10 days usage :1. Display is good not best2. Sound could have been better.3. Gamma Engine Not performed well3. UI is Decent(Modern Lightweight UI).4. Netflix,Amazon Prime YouTube and few apps are Preloaded5. Inbuilt Chromecast Performing Well5. bezels Design perfect6. Best Budget Android Smart TV7. Major advantage of this TV is Google assistant . Works like a charm everywhere and you don\\'t have to type.8. Some Bugs Present in TV OS,First to review 43y1, as my experience with 43 inch So far i liked the Tv.Tv is by default on energy saving picture mode, change to desire mode to get best picture experience, as i changed many picture settings the picture quality is way better than MI & realme me.Sound quality for my living room is more than enough, dolby atmos work carm with my Tatasky HD channels as they support dolby audio.The Lag is fixed to much extent.last input memory is also fixed, TV remembers the last input before switching off.The installation was bit crisp as the guy didn\\'t turn on the promised date, so amazon escalated and yesterday new guy came and installated.Cherry on the cake the installation was free also the wall mount bracket worth Rs500 was provided free by the installation team.Installed and the demo was given very promptly.Also to be noted this 43 inches has different graphic processor than 32 inches G51 Mp3Updating my experience of 4 days -Experienced lag nly twice in 4 days.TV takes a approx of 1 min to get ON.There\\'s a bit motion blur, which would be fixed by update, as it arises due to the DNR in the settings.Sound output is overall good at this range can\\'t expect soundbar like bass.Pre-Book extended warranty has been activated and mail confirmation received from acko.Picture quality is just awesome, with setting proper backlight, contrast etc.Blacks are properly seen black.This has VA panel and i am not much concerned about viewing angles. VA Panels are best for the straight view angle as they produce good contrast and color reproduction,this TV does the same.Viewing angle can\\'t be reviewed from my end as I did see blur when viewd at 150 angle which is obvious for VA panel.Data saver option and alexa support is yet to be updated in this TV.As of now no alexa support for this TV as there\\'s no option to login to oneplus account, so my free echo dot is not of use with this TV as of now, may be they will provide the update to this.Updating my review with some test done1) RGB colour gamat test is performing perfectly on this TV. As you can see computer rgb reproduce proper color.2)motion blur is too much in this TV, expect to be fix via update.3) TV remote is Bluetooth and IR both, i turned of my bluetooth of Remote and using on IR as it\\'s draining battery, when on IR you can\\'t use Google assistant function.4) No support for Echo dot as of now confirmed, hopefully will be in update.5) No data saver option yet.6) backlight bleeding is present at 10% which is common for LED Tv.7) color reproduction is good too.Updating my review to some clarification and my experience 26/071) As echo dot is not compatible and no1 from oneplus has spoken about echo dot compatibility with Y series, i returned my echo dot for full refund.2)Those posting negative reviews due to echo dot not received, kindly add echo dot from cloudtail in cart with oneplus tv, u vll get it for free.3)Those posting negative reviews that after tv return oneplus gave nly 19965 rs, please return your echo dot too they remaining approx 3045rs will be refunded then only.4)I connected my JBl sound bar and watched movies on Prime , I bet the dolby atmos did its work 100%, and its natural u can\\'t expect soundbar sound at 23k.5) pre-book cashback of 1000rs is credited to my amazon pay balance.,I got it delivered by 21 july. Shipping was good but then bright spots started showing from the next day. Product quality isn\\'t good too. I advise you not to buy this oneplus TV\\'s,1. Picture quality is good. Look & Feel is good. I would quote \"Best in this segment TVs.\" I have explored most of the well noted brands in this price segment.2. Sound is 3/5. With Dolby Digital Plus enabled, it is better.3. TV build quality is good, Viewing Angles are good too.4. 4K Videos will be reset to 1080p and this is the maximum resolution for any video.5. Only 4.6GB memory is available out of 8GB.6. Oxygen Play is useless.7. There is bloatware instead of oneplus clean software motto.8. Accessing Tv with Oneplus connect App is 1 out of 5. Its a disaster.9. Wall Mount is free. It will be brought by installation provider, do not shell extra bucks for wall mount or installation.10. Apps take ~10 sec to open, I am expecting optimization over next updates.11. USB Ports doesn\\'t support FAT32 Memory sticks (Pendrive, Hard Disk, or Phone). I am disappointed for this one.12. Max viewing distance can be 8 feet. (My vision is 6/6 for both eyes)13. Though Google Play Store is given, you cannot install even google chrome. I see only Chinese apps are available even in google play store. Don\\'t expect to install apps just like you do it on smart phone.14. No issue with remote and response time is good too. Remote build quality is good too.15. No heating issues noted so far.16. Supports only 2.4 Ghz band WiFi.17. No manual power switch. If remote doesn\\'t work, it will be a hell with Tv.18. Chromecast has ~0.3 sec delay which is very bad if you connect with laptop and work with mouse/touch pad.Suggestion 1: If price is not a issue, go for Samsung or LG.Suggestion 2: Want to enjoy premium experience, buy premium Tv, do not expect to find it from Chinese brands. Time is money, the more time you spend in exploring the options and unboxing videos in YouTube, consider adding that amount to the TV you buy.Hope my review will be a help.,Brilliant TV at affordable price , first sale TV was returned back as it was defective one. Brought it 2nd time. It’s totally worth it!,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Product is on price 13k.  32inch y1Pros.Nice picture quality.Awsm dolby surround soundNo problem with casting with you tubeCons.Croma cast from mobile laging.Connect app not working.Data saver not available in 32 y1After 5 days..After dwnlg oxygen plan from play store croma cast is working without laging.Connect app is also working now.Data saver not found to 32y1,One star because of poor installation serviceI\\'ve received a call of installation guy at 10am he said he\\'ll be at location after 1.5 hour so I said ok please come waiting of him after 2 hours he didn\\'t came & stop picking the call, Suddenly after half n hour again I received the call he asked sir did engineer call you & visit your place I saidhl he called me at 10:00am but he didn\\'t come & even not picking my call I\\'m trying him alot after long conversation of half n hour he arranged another guy he gaves me the contact of another guy again I\\'ve called him he is saying sir I\\'ll be there after 2.5 hour which is completely hard for me too wait I was getting late for office as you know the problem of covid 19 offices fire there\\'s worker well after talk to with him I\\'ve send him location again he called me after 1 hour & said sorry I\\'m not coming o asked why??? Guy\\'s word was talk to my boss... Brother who is your boss??? I would I know again after 15 min. I\\'ve received call again sir I\\'m visiting your place for installation I was surprised that whole Amazon company engineers visiting my home??? Well again 20min he called me & said sir I\\'m not coming wtf??? This whole scene was of 10 am to 2:15pm then finally engineer came 3pm & installated the led the whole wait was of only 4 screws wow amazon please improve your service which is totally sucks I\\'ve missed my office.. led performance is good but the speaker sound is not up to the marks picture quality is good,Tv is awesome at this price.  Among all the competitors in this range of tv , oneplus tv is best.1. Viewing experience2. Sound3. Performance4. FluenceAll this upto mark.I\\'m giving 3 star because of the following reason.1. Oneplus connect app is not working with tv2. I\\'m unable to find any datasaver option3. Available storage is less,Was eagerly waiting for this Tv, it’s economically priced and I got it for 11.7k, super thin and lite weight..!! Thin Bezels and a absolute delight. Audio for a small room is great, bigger room it seems to be quiet less. Been using it whole day, just that one plus connect didn’t work with my iPhone and content from pendrive also not viewable at all, not sure if it’s supposed to be like that or there is some issue with the product.Called one plus customer care, who told One plus connect won\\'t work for iOS, and suggested to long press the home button and select one plus server to connect android and to my surprise iOS also can get connected and works flawlessly.Moving on to the pen drive issue after a lot of research, trial and errors-It works only on the format FAT32.,The video quality is good but  sound quality is average with marginal noise on higher volume. I have viewed Online content and seen DTH tv they  gives true colors and you will truly love it.Dolby sound quality is enough even for living room . For DTH opt for a Dolby supported settop box. I am using airtel xtream box (4k)which is only 2249 for airtel thanks customer .SOFTWARE lags at times and when you select Live TV at times it will not start and gets back to homescreen. Was able to mirror cast through oneplus connect. OnePlus connect app helps to use mobile as remote after the initial update. The viewing angles are ok but this is VA panel so nothing like IPS panel. OnePlus has done good job with regards to video quality as it gives DCI P3 color gamut . Google assistant works fine too. The best thing is the customer service OnePlus offers which is top notch and they listen to you with patience. After sales matter and customer service matter alot in this era. Overall worthy contender.,Bought during first sale on 5th July.This TV is a blot on the name of One Plus, they shouldn\\'t have launched any product with such poor quality.Picture quality is very poor, colors doesn\\'t look natural at all, tried all the color settings. May be good for a monitor but not definitely good as a TV.Sound quality is the biggest setback, it sounds like a 3rd rate speaker and sound isn\\'t balanced. There is no clarity in the sound, you won\\'t be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen.Frame of TV isn\\'t durable, it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute.Summary: Don\\'t expect anything good from this TV, this product doesn\\'t deserve the One Plus brand name. One Plus should recall this product to maintain their brand image.I would have returned this product if there was an option.,Oneplus is settled for this cheap built quality,it comes with plastic body,screen is not at all good,if you pressure you can see liquid like flowing which we see in cheap quality products,sound is too worst,in an olden days when you full the volume you can get bad sound with disturbance now you can experience same with this tv,Ordered on 18th and got it by 20th Afternoon, here\\'s an honest review.But before that, here\\'s a few tips for people who are going to buy it.You\\'ll get an Echo Dot only if you order it with the tv at the same time, read the terms and conditions before leaving one star reviews because you didn\\'t order the echo dot from your end and obviously didn\\'t get it with the TV.To use the One Plus Connect app, you have to update the TV first, the OTA will be there when you turn on the TV for the first time.After that, open the connect server app on the TV, and then open the Connect app on the phone and it would work.Again, do a little research before leaving negative reviews and confusing the potential buyers.The type sync function(use the phone to type on the tv through the Connect App) doesn\\'t work as of now, but would start working in the next app update. Head over to the community forum for the one plus tv to find more details.If you talk about hardware, the TV is flawless, those who are complaining about the TV simply have a bigger room that the TV is designed for. You can always buy a soundbar if you think the volume isn\\'t sufficient for your room. For me, it\\'s more than enough.The display is top notch and the colors are vibrant. It\\'s truly bezel-less and looks beautiful.About the software, there are a few misses here and there, but I\\'m sure it can be fixed through a software update.ScreenCast lags a lot, I\\'m waiting for an update to see if it\\'s fixed.To people who think that the TV lags a lot, think of the TV as a phone with 1 GB RAM, if you keep opening apps repeatedly in a short period of time, the phone would lag, same is the case with the TV.It\\'s a value for money for those who don\\'t wanna spend a fortune to get a TV with a good display.,Firstly I did not receive my Amazon Echo Dot at no cost as promised.So I\\'m really pissed off however I liked the tv, good in quality and sound is pretty loud too.It\\'s absolutely slim and sleek.Beautifully designed.Kudos to designed team.Easy to browse through apps and quick and easy to connect to phone especially one plus phones.Screen cast is just a click away.Gotta do some more research on One Connect App.It\\'s giving me some hard time to connect to the TV.,I bought this TV in the first sale on 5th July and have been loving it. Amazon installation was prompt and it was set up the same day as the delivery. It is pretty light and slim, as given in the specs.The picture quality is fabulous, colors are right and everything about the display is better than normal. As a normal user, you wouldn\\'t notice any point of complaint regards to display.Speakers are loud enough, and we are bound to mostly use it at 25% of the maximum volume. Dolby surrounds sound is an added benefit that does enhance the sound experience of the TV.It runs Android 9.0 out of the box with Oxygen Play as the skin and the UI is pretty simple. It automatically fetches major information from the apps that you add to the home screen given you have signed in if required. The animations and transitions between application is sleek and there is no lag whatsoever. If you have used an android phone, the UI is no alien and the navigation will seem very familiar.The connectivity ports provided are ample and the WiFi reception is also pretty strong. I don\\'t know about the bells and whistles that other TVs come equipped with, but as a normal user who wants to enjoy his shows, videos, and cinema on a smart TV from all the contemporary sources like prime video, Netflix, youtube, etc., this is the perfect option.,It just got delivered on the second day of sale,fixed also, installation was done above 6 feet,1.Sound quality is not good.2.Remote is not actual bluetooth as it doesn\\'t sense 100%.3.With this price range we could have gone with the other brands.4.Only buy if you are 1+ lover other wise its not worth..,I have Purchased this TV within few minutes of the sale and completely unsatisfied with the product I received, the delivery was on time and had installed, but none of the wireless connectivity is working like wi.fi was not getting connected to the TV and could not connect the remote through the Bluetooth feature. The external view looks beautiful, the TV screen view was not that great.I want replacement AEAP. Awaiting for your reply.,Google assistant not working.complaint 25 times no solution,Pros:1. Price2. Reputable Brand3. Good Sound QualityCons:1. Over-Hyped2. Average Picture qualityConclusion:What you pay for is what you get. Don’t make the same mistake I made and fall for the way oneplus markets it!,TV responding to remote control is very slow due to 1 GB of RAM.,***First Impressions***+Pretty smooth and on-time delivery+Easy to configure+Impressive OnePlus Connect app+Game mode/OS/Chromecast-Bit low at audio part (nothing more can be expected with 20 W speakers)Overall - 👍Supported video formats and features will be updated soon.,Received a damaged tv with led panel visible from outside on edges . amazon technician visited site and informed tv is defective . But amazon rejected REPLACEMENT Saying item is not available and informed me to issue refund for an amount of 19961 For the tv where actually i paid rs 22999  for the order. They said echo dot is FREE with this product when bought together on the first sale, but they adjusted 3k to echo dot even they said its for free if bought together. And even after 10 days and 2 sales over after that. They are still saying that replacement is not available . Clear case of cheating . I have prebooked the TV before the launch of it only and still amazon is not even taking care of things. And rejecting replacement.,The picture quality and sound quality are good but the problem lies with the remote. The remote becomes non responsive after some time of inactivity and it starts working only after a good 5-10 mins. Adding to this, the Oneplus customer support is even poor! I waited for 15 mins just to get a message stating that no agents are available.This was not expected from Oneplus.,Maybe because of the high expectations I had, hence my greater disappointment. It\\'s an OK panel at best nothing too mind blowing. System lag is definitely noticeable and the picture is slightly oversaturated.But of course this is a budget TV and if you go for more expensive models of Sony, Samsung and LG you will have a better viewing experience. Everything else is fine. SUBPAR at best.Save up a little more if you can and go for more premium brands. Taste is subjective and if you\\'re on a budget this wouldn\\'t be the worst option either.,TV excellent 👌👌👏👏✌️✌️😍🥰 but... TV installation very very very bad 😠😡👎👎👎👎 not come any call and massage.now me open TV,TV quality is not great at all. The noise disturbance is way too much. Color options are very limited and way too saturated. Also, they did not provide any echo dot even though it was written that it would be offered free of cost along with OnePlus 43y1. Neither at the time of purchase they mentioned about it (later they added the process). Read everything before making a purchase of this disappointment.,Based on a real incident.At first remote\\'s down arrow button was not working. I was so not in a good mood. I hit the remote with my hand(just like all Indians do) . it started working.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0No doubt TV is value for money but has few small issues.1. It doesn\\'t gets on with single press of power button on remote.2. It is a bit slow because of 1GB RAM.3. Sound quality is not a expected.Few people mentioned about not receiving free echo dot. I got it for free just you need to add it to cart with TV and at checkout they will give a full discount for echo dot.,Display quality is top notch. Even though it\\'s FHD. And for the sound quality. I also had issue with it. But first go in sound setting and turn on surround sound and dolby sound. And then feel the real sound this TV can provide. Earlier i had an issue with TV not being able to turn on by remote. But after reading the manual i cane to know that to turn on TV it uses IR blaster on remote like old days unlike bluetooth. So u have to point it directly to the right bottom of the TV. A splendid purchase for the price. Really happy. And the display is really punchy and colour accurate.,Again good quality product deliver by oneplus . I m using mi tv past 2 years with lot of lagging while app to launcher switch. This tv has no problem faced still now . Remote working smoothly . Picture quality good .If u switch dolby digital plus, the  Sound quality of tv speakers is good. Also I connect ant sound bar to tv is amazing ( not great in mi tv ) . After update oneplus connect and chromecast working awesome. Tv valuable your money u wont regret....,Did a mistake of pre ordering it without even waiting for the review.1. The picture quality is not that great2. The interface has too much lags3. Audio quality is also not Upto the mark4. But has some of the coolest features5. Cannot complaint for 13k but expected a bit more improved product from oneplus ,I mean that’s what they are known for ; their speed and it certainly lacks in this tv.,Wast of money,It\\'s not a good tvSub standard product,picture was just ok.very slow interface.sound is very awful.if you look for a good tv.pls only buy prominent brands tv.very much disappointed with this purchase.,Writing after a months review.Bought this TV as just to test !Amazing powerful small TV,  32 inch with nice picture quality. It does what it says....Most importantly it works amazing with Amazon Prime, Hotstar etc...Many TVs in this segment claim to be smart , but fail to perform. Surprisingly, TV tv is indeed a powerhouse which works without any lag..! Amazing work by OnePlus with just 1GB RAM.Honestly speaking, no TV can offer what this TV is offering in this price range !I have nothing to complain about this TV.,When picture move fast then this TV not Handel picture quality.This TV sell without basic testing.On news channel button of TV news headline moving not Handel blur.Brightness feel your eye bad.Investment 1 or 2k more and buy lg TV.,HONEST REVIEW AFTER USING FOR 2 DAYS.I received the TV on the date mentioned, inspite of the travel restrictions as my address was listed in a containment zone. Good job by the Amazon delivery in Kollam (Kerala).The product is really worth the money you spend. All features mentioned work. You just have to update it first. \"Picture quality\" is excellent. Chromecast (Screencast) works fine. OnePlus Connect works (you have to follow the instructions in the app). All apps are working fine( Hotstar, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Netflix).You can connect the Echo Dot to this Television and it works perfectly fine.\"Sound quality\" is more than average compared to the negative reviews that have been mentioned. It is more than enough for the television. It will depend/vary on the platform you are using to view the videos.The Wall Mount was installed by the Service staff and they came at the correct time as agreed.OVERALLI am more than happy with the product. I was a bit skeptical about the product after ready all the negative reviews. But I have received a good product and it meets all the specifications mentioned by OnePlus. Great job by OnePlus in coming up with a budget TV.,Picture and quality is ok. But not work of Smart Phone Mirror Link function and Smart Phone as a Remote function. As I tried as per given instructions but not work. Many times hang the TV needs to restart by power cut and then on.,I recently purchased this 43\\' tv in amazon flash sale, for 24k and got a amazon echo dot along side with the tv, also pre-ordering the tv made may to additional 2 year of warranty, so that was a terrific purchase which intotal made a pretty good deal.ProsThe tv built was average,Looks great,display was crisp,picture quality excellent,android is smooth for now,Sound quality adequate for my use,Remote, wifi, Chromecast, bluetooth works fine.Cons.Low internal storageNo AUX portOverall a deal that can be recommended and will deliver satisfaction.,Not price worthy, its better to buy 32y1 than this. There are too many problems. The screen is so laggy and the sound quality is too poor also take time to work for some task and also if you plug in any external drive, it says to fromat.,Build quality is superb for this price range. Pic quality is similar to full HD there is no much difference like HD ready. Utube n other online streaming content clarity is good. There is no data saving alert. This can be used as a secondary bedroom TV. Sound is okay, u can connect it with external speakers. Little lag while moving through apps but that\\'s not an big issue, jus give sometime to load. We r dealing with 1gb ram and budget processor. Wall mount for this TV is not included. Better u itself buy wall mount stand in local, wall mount cost me 750rs for a 13k TV. Amazon please set a standard price for installation and let it be visible for us while ordering. Really frustrated by receiving a cheap local made wall mount for 750rs from the installater. Initially my wallmount amount was refunded by the technician, now he got it back after a month. The happy purchase of mine is now turned horrible. I reduce all the stars just for installation and the awesome service u have provided @tvse service,Experiencing issues. As TV remote is not working at all.. and till now no engineer has came to install the TV.,The OnePlus TV Screen just go BLACK after using for 1 day. The worst quality TV they have made which caused the TV dis-functioning with in just a single day. I want to return this please help me to get this TV returned and refund my money back to my account.,REVIEW # 1The launched was much awaited for & as soon as the sale for 43inch was out - we booked the TV. The addition of the Amazon Echo Dot was the Cherry on top of the Cake :-) The TV arrived the next day in Good Condition.OBSERVATIONS>> For this price - the TV has an elegant look. The Bezeless Display does indeed live up-to its mark. As per my calculations which includes the bottom logo bar as well - the display screen amounts to 89.74% of the total display.>> Image quality is indeed Amazing. The colours are vibrant. Images truly standout when fed with a 1080p input. The display does pure justice to 4K YouTube videos.>> Audio quality for this price segment yields no complaints. However, You will need a Sound Bar or Home Theater System if You want to enjoy the Video with Bass powered Sound. The TV promises Dolby Audio - but lacks Bass (obviously due to Sound Physics as it does not have a woofer) But still satisfies for a medium sized living room.>> Inputs are adequate taking into consideration the present technological advancements. 2 HDMI inputs for Your STB & Gaming Console. However a 3rd HDMI would have been great to have as spare to connect to a laptop (No really needed though as the TV comes with built-in Chromecast for Screen Mirroring)>> I would rate the OS response 4.25 out 5 as there is some minor lag when using the OS. When I received the TV, I installed the 823Mb update (dated 17Jun) but I believe there should be another update which should improve the OS Performance and fix some bugs within. A bug being the OS is unable to handle a Non-ARC HDMI device well. I enabled the HDMI-ARC service not knowing that my STB does not support ARC. Due to this there is a Blue rotating loading Circle constantly turning on my display when on HDMI input. Of-course disabling this service gets rid of the Blue Circle (But for OnePlus it would be nice to see a popup stating that the input device does not support ARC rather than have a constant Blue Circle on the Screen). Also, my OS still does not have the Data Saver feature which many users have stated that they do not see on their TV\\'s. So anxiously waiting for the next OTA Update.>> As many users are raised the issue - Heavy Lag while using Screen Cast/Mirroring. Hoping again then the OTA update would fix this.>> TV Remote functions purely on Bluetooth. The Remote is compact & has a minimalist design. The best part being the remote has 3 dedicated buttons for OTT apps (Netflix, Prime & YouTube). A drawback I see in the remote is due to it being purely Bluetooth - I no longer can use my Universal Remote for my TV. Also I believe there is a bug in the remote which does not let You switch on the TV instantly (sometimes You have the press the Power button a few times - clearly visible on the red flashing led on the remote) Hoping OTA will fix this issue too. Another issue (my suggestion) with the remote is that it misses the Input Source Button. This missing button makes it extremely difficult for my not so technologically advanced Mother to switch between inputs.>> Another thing that surprises me is that there is a Dedicated Amazon Prime Video Button on my Remote but NO inbuilt Alexa integration. I have to use a Skill on Alexa but unfortunately like many other people I haven\\'t been able to connect my OnePlus TV to my Alexa Account. This makes the supplied Echo Dot 50% useless as I cannot use the Echo Dot to wake up my TV via voice command. Yet to try Google Assistant (but I want Alexa functioning as my other devices are synced with Alexa) If You are reading this point and have been able to Integrate Your OnePlus TV to your Amazon Account - then Please leave me an Answer on my Question.>> The last point being - I am not sure if its a design flaw or a shipping mishap - But the TopLeft & TopRight corners seem to be either damaged or poorly finished by the Assembly Team. (See Images)Overall - this Product has so far satisfied me well. I will certainly be writing another Review when I have the OTA Update to fix some of the Bugs & Add the Missing Features. Until then I will enjoy my OnePlus TV :-)Lastly, 5 Stars to Amazon for providing the option of 2Year Extended Warranty for INR1000 and automatically adding it to my OnePlus after 3 days of arrival. In addition, just as promised returing me the INR1000 back as Amazon Pay Balance. Such offers keep customers like Me Happy.,Menu button not working since day one. Volume getting high and low suddenly on its own. Need to watch tv with remote in hand to control sudden change in volume. As per the tv engineer, this issue is with all oneplus TVs and it cannot be resolved. Also, the echo dot device doesnt work with this TV as of now.,Tv looks AwesomeBut i suggest You don\\'t buy This 720P panel TVGo for Atlest full Hd TV if you canCoz picture Quality is Not so goodAtlest Buy any full hd tv,Great picture qualitySuperb Dolby soundNice oxygen app well performedMy family is very happy to see in this tvI have 55 inch another company tv but colour combinations in this tv is great  we r very happy with one plusDon\\'t FOLLOW bad commentsPlease go with this tvI\\'m using it and give u best REVIEW,Product delivered on 7th July...but almost 12 days gone installation is not done by Qdigi and no support by amazon.,Add clearly says it is along with Eco dot.. worth of 1999/- but it is not,  there is separate procedure to avail it. if this is a free why one more procedure required ? it is eye wash to customer.,1) This TV not working with Alexa. (Keep Your Mind Before purchase)2) Dolby sound is Fantastic. you will get Awesome movie experience.3) Picture Quality is also good.4) Tv remote also working good. (Little lag but it\\'s fine)5) Amazon TV installation service tooooo much bad not on time always 1-2 days let. don\\'t accept they will do at the time.6) Amazone Delivery at time time. ( No dout about Delivery system too good.) I\\'m trust on ONEPLUS blindly ( 1+ Never Settle)  Overall tv experience is Amazing, we loving it ❤️,Quite good product for the price. Product is light weight and looks very delicate. Colors are beautiful. Sound system is also great with dolby. But the main problem I found is, the speakers are located at bottom. So if you place if on a table, the sound won’t be clear. I’m facing the same issue now.. but if you are going for wall mount option, then go for it. Neither of the Competitors can give you the best colour viewing experience.,Sound is too bad and you will literally cry for that ...Picture quality is okayish and software is good ..Forget about oneplus connect feature ...One word review:- Oneplus TV Y series  is not good,Baught 2 oneplus tvPros-Picture Quality Is exellent even Better than My previous Sony and Lloyd Tv\\'s . Even Though it is HD ready panel not the Full hd But if You Watch It from 4-5 feet distance , the Display Look crisp and ClearSound Is Very Loud and ClearAnd With The Support of Dolby Atmos and Surround Sound It feels Like A theater experience in small RoomUi Is As Smooth As Oxygen os on Oneplus PhonesBezzals are very Thin infact the Thinnest In sagmentCons-There\\'s no wall mount with the tv inside The Box or Out Of the Box. If you are From small City or Village Area there\\'s no Installation service Provided by amazonThere\\'s No Data saver Option in 32 inch modelOverall after comparing with My previous Tv\\'s and considering The Price of just ₹13000 the Tv gives You more Value Than the Money You are PayingFeels Like 20000₹ tv or even MoreWill Buy 2 more oneplus TVs in next sale,Picture colour blinking after 2 days disconnect automatically from wifi network,Tv is Very nice but Amazon installation service very bad  installation price 400And late 4 days bad installation unpurfasonal engg,I feel greatful to get such opportunity to review this product. This is my first time attachment to oneplus and its truely great...Now talk about this product all the features are great and picture quality is mindblowing but there are some disappointment in sound system,  it should be better... But at this price range I cant expect more. If you can attach a sound system to this then it will be a remarkable product at this price,The video and sound quality are awesome. you will truly love it. Dolby sound quality is enough to even for the living room. For DTH opt for a Dolby supported set-top box. Software optimization is top-notch. Was able to mirror cast. OnePlus connect app helps to use mobile as remote after the initial update. The viewing angles are great for a VA panel. OnePlus has done a good job with regards to video quality as it gives DCI P3 color gamut and feels of Full HD tv. Google assistant works fine too. The best thing is the customer service OnePlus offers which is top-notch and they listen to you with patience. After-sales matter and customer service matter a lot in this era. Overall satisfied.,When I purchased this tv there is a offer of eco dot is free with it but they do legal fraud with customers which we can\\'t do any think. Even when I said to customer center for writing complaint but they said we can\\'t write complaint bcz we didn\\'t violet terms and conditions it\\'s really bad from Amazon India but about one plus tv picture quality is much better, sound is ok ok over all tv is good with this price range.,Average picture qualityBelow average sound qualitySometimes lagy software (hope fix next update)No issue on connectivityOveral worth for 13kInstallation...Very bad installation service for TVS EThey are aoutomaticaly change date to 5 timesNo customer support from amazon and oneplusAfter 5 times complaint,,,,Installation done..Poor service,Chronology of events:-==================22-Oct-20: Ordered and Amazon Delivered OnePlus Y Series 108cm(43inches) TV23-Oct-20: Installation was doneThe TV had issues as display goes blank, sound gets distorted after connecting with bluetooth, volume goes missing when TV is turned on.29-Oct-20: Technician visit request was raised within 10 days validity .31-Oct-20: Technician visited and checked the issue and further confirmed that issue exists in the TV but did not provide any Job Order/Receipt.I was unable to place a request for return/refund and did multiple follow ups with the technician again to share Job Order/Receipt but he refused and later did not pick up my call.I reported this incident to Amazon Call Support, and they asked me to open another service request due to inconvenience by the service provider and the return/refund of the product remains valid as the technician visit request was made within 10 days.31-Oct-20: 2nd time, Technician visit request was raised.01-Nov.-20: I did Follow Up-1 with Amazon Call Support and assured that technician will contact me within 24hrs.; but no success.02-Nov.-20: No response/visit from Technician.02-Nov.-20: I did Follow Up-2 with Amazon Call Support who contacted the service provider and assured that technician will contact within 48hrs.; but no success.05-Nov.-20: Still No response/visit from Technician.05-Nov.-20: I did Follow Up-3 with Amazon Call Support who asked me to open/re-schedule the technician visit request and the issue was explained and he transferred the call to Amazon Technical Support and issue was again explained and he transferred the call to Amazon TV Appliances Support and issue was again explained and he assured that installation team/ technician will contact within 48hrs, else I should again report the technician no show with Amazon Call Support.

At this price this is the best. Picture quality is fabulous. Apps work fine. Only it lags a bit, don\\'t use it for gaming. Only  for  viewing  TV.,Great product again from oneplus.picture quality is superb, screen size and picture ratio is best in this range. Sound quality is ok when u compare it with vu cinema which have 40w speakers. But all in all nice TV in this range from oneplus.,It could not even run for 3days and now I am not getting a refund/replacement,Update after using for more than A month - very late response and also laggy device kindly think before buying this one !! I have oneplus 8 mobile still doesn\\'t work hassle free it\\'s too slow Remote response is almos 4-5second late!!no wall mount was provided by the oneplus.. nor was available with the installation team.. had to use my old wall mount.. all over happy.. pls mention for wall mount (additional charges) if required before the installation guy comes,Display quality is excellentsound is okconnectivity with ott apps are little bit slowno screen mirror option only chrome cast but you can do the job with an additional device via hdmi portfinally to say worth for price in this segmentTv installation service become a bit challenge in my area,Quite satisfied with the product for the price range.For people complainting about lag issue, its nothing to do with ram ir storage Just pair the remote with bluetooth. By default remote works with ir which needs a straight line of sight. Once you pair it as bluetooth it works like a charm.To pair the remote with bluetooth, just go to setting in tv and click on Remote and Accessories. Adter that click left and home key simultaneously on remote. It will be paired and no lag issue will be there,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Loving the picture quality and the thin bezels.Wasn\\'t expecting great sound from the reviews but am surprisingly satisfied from the output for my room.All the OS features working after the update.Oneplus connect was not that useful till now.The remote is nice.,after installation of 2nd day that black line was on screen its faulty pic,Worth buying for 20k as you get echo dot free with this the best in class tv for 20 and in 43 inch catagory it\\'s the best value for money the package and the built-in quality is just OnePlus++ Go For It if you are look for the 43 inch catagory this is a must buy ✌️✌️I\\'ll use some more days and update some Details 😊,*First impressions*Picture quality is top notch, Bezel-less design and worth for money. Sound quality is decent for the price. Product Delivery and installation was on time.Will update the usage review after a month.,1.Very good picture quality2. Dolby sound is very nice3.wifi and Bluetooth connectivity is very fast4.Edge display5.remote is very smart,I thought OnePlus is showing fake bezels on this TV in their advertising material like other brands do but in real also they r thin. TV is perfect.,Superb smart tv at very affordable price . The best installetion support , update are quick. The best picture  quality and does not require any external soundbar . The apps opens quick and googel assistant is best on remote...Made in india , country of origin also india.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0It\\'s bad that it doesn\\'t hav a data saver. That is one good feature it must be added.After two days the tv is not getting ON... showing lik above video.It might be a manufacturing defect. if fixed den it is good tv,The product I received was defective, the installation executive came to my premises and submitted a job sheet to amazon mentioning its defective. The panel did not switch on , I guess I was the most unluckiest person to receive the defective product, expected more of 1plus tv , very bad experience initially,  hope I get my replacement tv soon, I request amazon to expedite the process, I waited nearly a week to receive the product another couple of days for the installation person to open it and declare it as defective, how long should it take for the replacement and how long for the service person to open the box and install the tv from it\\'s original packing???????????,I heard that OnePlus products have their separate identity. so i decided let take a chance.  I got it on next day of sale i.e. on 6th of July till then installation was pending. now it get done on 15th of July.  that\\'s ht long time but i must tell you after the starting the Tv... that\\'s the MasterPiece i ever saw. all things you need is in that. you connect surf whatever you want. Overall Awesome TV, my whole family is happy with that.शेवटी काय... घरचे खूष तर आपण खूष :),The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Just after 9 day of use screen started to flicker, which at first I thought might be connection issue or just a passing thing. But by the next day, you can see the reference video. And by all this time showing faith on the brand got me into trouble, as 10 days were done now.Then, the real game started. I got to taste the real service by customer support.haha.. It all started with simple sweet talk, no problem sir.. we will get it done attitude. Then came I have to talk to my executive, then, there is a form to be filled out and you will get a revert.Then, passing it to the so called concerned team.and then they were like we need a technician to visit and see what\\'s the problem ( as if video was not enough, still ok).Then came the game of passing the responsibility. Amazon\\'s technician ---> talk to amazon and they will send in the replacement,Amazon---> we don\\'t have authority to give a replacement, oneplus needs to do it.. talk to their support.andthen oneplus doing the same stuff on repeat mode.. no response to email, even after 11 days.Had to wait for chat for 1hr, to talk to esteemed oneplus chat service. Again some sweet talk, will revert to you in 24hrs.Then, called oneplus and they again said amazon will do we can\\'t..Great service and great companies..Update: 06/11/2020Yet to get a solution!! hahaha.. getting mad laughing!!,Just an awesome TV at this price point. It does has some limitations and lags but at this price point, no complaints.It\\'s better than all the other brands available at this price,Good picture quality, unfortunately returning only due to the presence of some horizontal lines on the screen. Otherwise excellent product for this price.,TV is excellent but for installation called many times and after many calls on 3rd time resheduling installation done,otherwise 5 stars from my side,Very cheap in Built quality I am disappointed with OnePlus never expecte this type or of products launch by OnePlus,Excellent and satisfied with the tv, sound quality was amazing and installation was done after 6 days. Intially the tv was slow when connected to internet,later it was working normally.The screen casting also very fast and finally thanks to the installation team for installing the tv before intial scheduled appointment.,First of all you have to change the picture settings and then boom the display is amazing 😍👌. And the dolby sound is very loud as i thought about. A must buy product. Thanku Amazon for this beauty.,Product is average, plastic material is not good, booting up is fast, applications like Amazon prime do es not work properly sometimes, it is okay for PPL who uses only for dish TV purpose, android version is not up to the mark, Led screen is okay, average product, okay for the price given.,No alexa support and OnePlus customer care even don\\'t know if this y series tv support alexa or not.. amazingSound is really poor .. and OS issues as it\\'s lags so much .. 3 sec window after pressing remote button..Good picture quality with apps and games but when check with normal SD channel, it\\'s really poor..Overall don\\'t expect any support from OnePlus customer care.. they are pathetic.. called 5 times in last 7 days and still they are checking alexa issue ..strange na ?,Data saver is must needed for TVs when Streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video doesn’t allow you change the streaming quality, it streams by default at FHD 1080p, consuming around 6 GB hourly. I stopped watching at all. I thought OnePlus would include Data Saver in their Y series as well but they didn’t and it’s their in U and Q series. . The TV is Gorgeous in terms of hardware and picture quality, I’d say best in class. I hope they’ll added it in next update. Also the OnePlusConnect app doesn’t work AT ALL. Thanks Oneplus.,Picture quality good sound average connectivy,The packaging was simple and easy to unpack. As mentioned in the description the packaging includes TV, remote, user manual (warranty included), AAA battery. Wall mount is not included.The TV is very slim, light weighted and easy to setup. Display looks good, sound is fine. Operating the tv is easy too.,Audio stopped working after 15 days and One Plus is not supporting and asking to contact Amazon, not sure who will help with this. One of problems buying online products.,Full HD 1080p video picture good,Sometimes remote is not responding well,Sound could\\'ve been better,New app install,update, uninstall are very easy,Also have Some pre-installed app,which is not uninstallable.Overall good tv, better than Mi.,This product is very good and excellent sound quality..don go with the negative review ..this product is just awesomeThe review in youtube and other social media platforms are totally wrong.I personally used this tv .,I got 32 y last Wednesday itself came in good package, no issues with Amazon or OnePlus packages, picture and sound is dope even it connected easily with my LAN and phone.,The TV is good for the price you pay. We things that I would like to suggest/bring it to notice1. This not yet compatible with Alexa2. sound output is average, would recommend a sound bar to enhance sound quality (try Blaunpaunkt SB-100)3. Picture quality is good - few backlight bleeds. You will need to set it to correct color setting to have a good viewing experienceRest is good! Hoping Oneplus would give OTA updates to resolve few things,It\\'s disappointing to see that sound was not something one plus put their efforts to improve, fortunately I didn\\'t get a laggy TV mine works fine although power on and off with the remote is tricky and build quality is the lowest I expected, there are haps everywhere very low quality body. Have to be very fragile while moving it, although having these problems I don\\'t think I will return the product. But still to play a game with a brand image of one plus, it really did some damage this time. I won\\'t recommend this if you are saving up for an immersive experience it lacks some of the basics of TV requirment.,Great deal although little bit disappointed for speaker but in this price range its worth itTips: buy prime membership before buying this tv its worth it😂,The first time I\\'m writing against one plus, the way one plus brand its image is great, but when it comes to Television section it\\'s worst. It\\'s just 2 days y series 3w inches tv has gone wrong with its technical issues, where the wifi is not getting connected, smart tv without wifi connectivity is as waste as it is. After raising complaint to one plus tv 2 days back yet no one responded. I suggest everyone\\'s go ahead with mi 32 better price best quality as my cousin uses it from one long year.Amazon was best at service recently even it turned out to be worst.After delivery of defect product, still amazon wabt back up and make Customer feel terrible on service as returns the product.Amazon dosent have option to retun money, abd they won\\'t pace up in service too. Post collection of tv amazon tele representative says it will take 10 days to get deliver new one.I dint understand why I\\'ve to wait after paying 15k and getting defective. Amazon tele representative says be patience, cos of this guy\\'s service it\\'s creating mental agony, worst service from Amazon and worst product from one plus. Two big brands loosing their image.,Great picture quality, good sound(lacks the bass effect, but Dolby audio enhances the sound), best tv in the price segment. Don\\'t think twice, just go for it.,1) product is made in india2) Picture quality -  super3) Sound - super4) Connectivity - super ( no buffering prime or Netflix or YouTube ) Feels like theatre experienceWon\\'t work proper with OnePlus phone to OnePlus tv lags too muchWorth buying @12,999/-,Picture quality is best with super colorsSound is not upto the mark...tried bass but it\\'s ok for 20W also tried surround sound it\\'s ok.Checked screen cast..lil bit of delay in it.Hope you find this helpful. 🙏,Excellent features and working also perfect.best tv on budget simply buy it,I got this TV on 5th Sept. After 16 days, both the HDMI ports stopped working. I have initiated the warranty claim by Amazon three times but it has been 10 days and no one came to repair the TV. Worst service by amazon. I am a prime customer but now I regret. Talking to a lot of people and asking them to Visit Amazon to give honest reviews on all the products. There is a lot going behind the bars now and quality has reduced drastically.,Best TV at this price available in market no complaints about it every thing is good and fantastic 👌 only thing is you need OnePlus or Apple device to connect to oxygen play but you can also access it on the TV so no issues,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Everything is just Perfect Except Sound quality.Bass lovers should buy soundbar to experience this amazing Product.,Best priceGood pictureGood screenI hate soundsSpeaker not goodTemple speaker thu,Simple and nice tv with loads of features in small budget happy with the quality and performance , thank you Amazon and one plus for delivering the best beast tv.😇,Everything is just amazing. Only OnePlus connect is useless. But it\\'s ok. When you have normal remote. You really don\\'t need that stupid application. Please go ahead and buy it. You can trust amazon and the installation company to help you during any ups and down. They are really helpful. Installation is free and wallmount is also free. You don\\'t have to pay 1 rupee also. If you don\\'t ask them to put new switch board or wiring or something. They will come drill 2 holes and put the mount and will go. Simple and easy.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Bought this product on October 2020.Tv was quite impressive in the beginning and picture quality was also good.On April 2021 tv screen got black, sounds are coming but no visual.(technician told panel issue)It\\'s been 2 months but my tv problem is not yet resolved .Let\\'s see whether tv will be repaired or not under warranty duration. I hope Amazon will help me out ASAP.#oneplus #amazon #qdigiI will update my feedback guys about warranty promises shared by OnePlus group. Whether it is real or painful.I hope I will not lose my trust from OnePlus brand. They will sort this out and help me too.ThanksAbhishek,Got defective PC. The same has been informed the TV Installer.Dead pixel and damaged on bezel.Don\\'t purchase this.,after using couple of weeks, i am writing this review/my opinionOnePlus TV is similar in to MI TV , VU TV , Realme TV, Motorola TV in terms of functions and performance.there is no brand mark on the TV. I am neither happy nor sad.Don\\'t wait for the flash sale. go for any TV all are same,Didnt expect from oneplus ... bad sound quality... lags ... aftr 10 days appers lines on tv ... i cant return tv bcoz return period is over .... very worst build ... please dont buy,Remote conectivity is slow and sound clarity is some less rather than tv is amazing super extraordinary tv nice in budget,Too slow with lag due to less RAM. Did not expected this from OnePlus. Avoid buying this one.,Overall it\\'s a good TV for the price. I got the 43\" TV , echo dot and 3 years of warranty.I did find it a bit laggg initially, but seemed better after the first update. The wall mount took an additional ₹800.,Like this tv very much. Better picture quality, good sound and connection. Floor stand distance is high so couldn\\'t accommodate in my small TV table. Sometimes prime get restart automatically. Otherwise it\\'s a pakka product.,Thumbs up for timely delivery and installation for Amazon.Review after 10 days.Picture quality is good and for the price is great. As got 3500rs. Echo dot and 2years extended warranty.,It\\'s looking very good till now... However i installed it on my own... Installation is pretty late by delivery,Tv is looking great physically and also its interface easy to useOnly one problem i am facing that  is connecting the tv to the settop box through hdmi 2 port always mute the audio after power on but hdmi 1 arc port is working fine . Also i cannot control the volume of the tv in the settop box using settop box remote on Dolby mode,I purchased this only for the brand name. You get a woww factor when you say you have one plus Tv.Other than that it is pretty normal TV for this price range. You get cheaper (1-2k) Tv from Thompson, Mi and VU for this price range. So you are actually paying 1k for this brand value and nothing else as the specs and performance match with other Tv brands.Display quality is very good and sound could have been better, these are on par with other TV on this same price range. Down firing speakers make sound little muffled.Casting works perfectly in both android and iPhone. Airtel Xrteam or jio live tv app is not available for any TV models but you can run it on phone and cast it to TV. So you don’t have to purchase a DTH or cable with smart TV with built in chromecast.TV does become slow when you open multiple apps but this is problem in all budget Tv models.2 hdmi ports is not a problem at all. As mostly you would only use 2 ports. 1 for dth and 1 for playstation. Since moving to OTT we no more use DVD or blue ray players. Also chromecast is inbuilt, so there is really no need for 3rd hdmi cable.,Nice productPicture quality is awesomeIn budget of 23k it\\'s good to buy and u get echo dot freeAnd if u purchase the extra waranty it is free with itIf u don\\'t add echo dot while purchasing then u will not recieve with tv u have to add to cart during purchasing with tv then checkout for paymentScreen cast is laggy. Sound quality is ok.,Great product at 11600..after card discount..Amazing panel and color depth..Go for it..wont regret,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Nice quality,picture quality\" is 4/5 ,\"value for money\" is 4/5 & \"sheerness\" is 4/5 all over.1.

Find following flaws after using TV for a couple of days.1. TV getting hang quite often.2. Very slow processor3. Remote is slow. Sometimes command do not reach the TV4. Very bad build quality. Cheap material used.5. No buttons in TV set apart from Power.6. Bluetooth does not works properly.7. Oneplus and amazon technical team dont have knowledge about the product.8. Bluetooth Speaker/headphone do not connect automatically. It require to unpair everytime to re-connect.9. Sound quality not upto thr mark.Not expected this from Oneplus.,TV is very good at this price. Installation was not done by the service provider. As promised by Amazon, Eco dot was not provided along with the TV.,This was not accepted from OnePlus.I bought this 32\" tv on it\\'s first sale.Picture Quality : is like LCD tv, not Like LED tv.Sound Quality: is not comfortable to ear. Need more concentration to hear sound to understand the words.Design: Design is goodRemote: Remote is also goodNeed an update to fix this issue but if it is a LCD tv then no update can fix the picture quality of this tv.Hope for the best,This is fantastic tv ever. please do not trust any bad review i personally loving it.there is not any lag issue.,Very slim and best tv under 13k,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I am a OnePlus user since 2015. Never expected these sort of cheap quality product from OnePlus.Tv stopped working after 2 months. Display is blank now.  OnePlus service is pathetic.  They are not responding even 2 weeks after raising the complaint. Don\\'t waste money on this Crap.,Expected a lot... but basic things not functioning1. The Jio 5G connection doesn\\'t get listed and hence cannot be selected.2. The connect app doesn\\'t connect3. Though Chromecast is available I have been unable to cast anything4. Sound is not smooth,Remote sensitivity is very low when compare to Mi tv. Its ver hard for me to change the channel,Had an extremely poor experience with OnePlus TV.TV screen turns black on random occasions but frequently, it again turns back on in 30sec to 5 min.Sounds stops working similarly.Picture turns green randomly.This doesn\\'t feel like a OnePlus product. Even local brands provide better products.After all this, i applied for replacement and then amazon scheduled an inspection service and the inspection guy didn\\'t show up. Had to rescheduled it two more times but no one shows up. Contacted amazon and told the whole scenario then they replaced it directly.Got the replaced product but the issues are still there and this time the product feels like second hand. Only that this time the issues ka worse and more frequent that last one.Filed a return request, again got inpection service scheduled and after explaining previous experience to customer care, this time got a call from inspection guy. He made a video of the issue. He said that he has verified the issue but I did not receive any response from Amazon regarding this.And the worse thing, Amazon is not providing customer care support now. Tried multiple times but didn\\'t recieve any call from Amazon. Feeling stuck with this defective product.Won\\'t be using Amazon for a long time now.Update: After initiating the return order again, Amazon sent people for picking up the defective item. Now waiting for refund initiation.,Excellent picture quality,Best Primium look.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I\\'m one OnePlus fan always, TV in this low bedget is very good. Sound quality need improvement. Picture quality is good and over all value for money.,Good product.worth buying at this price point.picture quality is awesome.sound is good.but no bass.Bezzle less design is Good.Worth buying at this price.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0It\\'s awesome tv at 13k, except for viewing angles.It\\'s color production and lookwise it\\'s unmatchable.From front on it matches any full HD TV, interface is smooth.Color production is really good, blacks are really black like OLED panelFrom sides it\\'s colors fade is noticable, it\\'s the only but big negative from OnePlusWhen it comes to sound it is good while streaming through apps like YouTube, hotstar,, with set of box it\\'s bit low.No lag in OS, remote is easy to operate and premium look.After 6 months usage , it\\'s going great and really satisfiedAfter almost 1 year usage I\\'m satisfied with this TV , picture quality is of high class, one issue noticeable is there is a 3 mm gap at the base frame, not a major concern but OnePlus need to take care.If you are using it only with set of box use a good hdmi cable , it will really enhances viewing experience. With AV cables you will get very poor picture quality.It\\'s one year of moderate use , but I\\'m getting back light issues on screen, currently it\\'s not a issue while watching , but if it continues to intensity it will be a issue, I didn\\'t expect that within a year.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Respected viewer,I know before purchasing this expensive leisure you will be viewing the rewievs let me tell you this TV has a great picture quality and smart features but this crashed in just 3 days of use . I purchased this TV long time back and it was kept in one corner of my house and then after a hell lot of scams one fine day a totally unprofessional fellow came to install it ...... After damaging the whole wall with innumerable drills he installed it and didn\\'t even explain the features which , somehow , we got to know about.....then he charged the double price for the wall mount.....then after thousands of complaints finally we got a refund. Would suggest to buy from a showroom. Hope you find it helpful but informally would like to tell if you don\\'t want to fall in any sort of problem .... Then please don\\'t purchase this product !Have a good day,Wonderful picture quality . Easy to operate but one plus connect app doesn\\'t work. Volume is not that much. But it\\'s worth it for the price it comes under,Price is reasonable, picture quality is good. Connectivity also good, remote is small and good, sound is ok, need to explore more, bazzle is almost negligible.. Looks good,In this price you can\\'t ask for more.Awesome picture quality , a bit slow operating system else everything is good.,Just Amazing🤩😍Best in the segmentNo competition with thisGreat Colors and bezel less display.,Amazing,OnePlus tv is best....but amazon courier faciliti is very very bad...I am very irritating for wating this product...,For this much price we can say TV is good in every aspect. But there is a lagging problem. It\\'s taking time to open any app.,I am not too happy with this one. I had huge expectations. Too much of LED bleeding issues and patches across the panel. I am awaiting an inspection from Amazon. So hoping for a replacement soon. Initial overview, price wise a good deal, if my panel issue gets resolved. But if you don\\'t consider the price, this comes nowhere near to a Samsung panel.,The most horrible thing about this tv is its remote control . Very much irritating you to press the button 3-4 times to change something , not expected this from one plus . Although this tv has a good picture quality , average sound clarity and a decent bezel - less display . It can be said a value for money product . But the remote connectivity and performance is awful.,Waiting since last 1 year for 43 in TV. Finally able to purchase. More value for less money.,Happy with product,Value for money,Screen is bit delicate except tht everything is fine awesome design,so far so good...,If you\\'re going to purchase this product make sure you have atleast 4gb / day data plan dedicated to this TV.Also you need a WiFi router for getting full functionality.Let me start with the pros1. Picture quality is great. You\\'ll need some Tweeks though. Set it on movie preset for day time use. Energy saving for night time use. I reduced backlight to 20 and it\\'s in user mode to reduce eye strain.2. Audio quality is good. You also need a lot of Tweeks though.Set it in movie preset if you\\'re watching movies. This preset let\\'s you hear all the music details also you\\'ll hear the dialogues crystal clear. In this mode you won\\'t hear bass that much. You\\'ll get a hint of base nothing much. Because base will affect the Dialogues.Set it in music preset if you\\'re listening to music in this preset you\\'ll hear all the highs and lows crystal clear. You\\'ll get bass as well.Okay now discuss about the consEverything else in this TV is a con.It has data saver installed but you can\\'t able to access it. Data savers has an update in playstore. For some reason it\\'s not updating.You can\\'t use this TV as a Bluetooth speaker. You have to cast your phone screen in order to play your music on TV screen.Which brings a lot of problems. First you need a WiFi router with 2 GB data dedicated to this TV for casting only. Because it\\'s using Chromecast not miracast. So what happens is, you are sharing your mobile screen to your TV using mobile data even though it\\'s on same network. Which is stupid. Why in the world I have to spend my data to transfer the data packets using my router. It\\'s on same network for god\\'s sake.Also while casting if you open YouTube in your phone it opens YouTube app on tv, so you\\'ll end up spending 3X data for playing YouTube video. ( For playing in mobile, for transferring data to tv and for the video playing on TV). But fellow competitors like mi TV also have built in Chromecast only. I don\\'t know any budget TV which supports miracast, if you knew comment below to let me know.It can only access hard disc upto 2tb.Some apps like Udemy are not supported on this TV.You\\'re going to spend more money on ott, let me explain how.. if you\\'re going to use Netflix on TV you\\'ll need premium subscription to add 2-4 devices at a time. Also if you have Airtel xstreme on your phone, and thinking I can use Airtel xstreme on tv.. you\\'re wrong.. you need to purchase xstreme for TV as well.If you\\'re rich enough to purchase all ott platforms and have enough money to spend 4gb / day data on TV on regular basis, you\\'ll love this TV.Otherwise you\\'re gonna end up hating this TV and yourself for purchasing this TV.I chose to purchase this TV because it\\'s an Android TV, also home services during warranty period is free. I don\\'t have to take this TV to the service centre, if there\\'s something\\'s wrong. After warranty period they charge ₹450 for the service. Which is cheaper than other brand.But if I knew I\\'m gonna get this for ₹16k I wouldn\\'t even think about purchasing this TV. Because I got these picture and audio in my old Sansui LCD tv. Which lasted 5 years without any issues.,Excellent TV, picture quality superb-5*, for Sounds I will give 4*, for connectivity-5*. Overall excellent TV in low budget better than others Brands,Outstanding🤩🤩🤩I love it . Nuch better then MI led,Good in this price,Awesome product, superb audio n video,really experienced with 4k video n dolby audio.but Google chrome not installed in this,I booked repair service by Oneplus care App .  No one come and update the status. too many time tried to contacting customer care of Oneplus. no acknowledgment. And tried booked by amazon warranty & services. No one come on appointment date they reschedule the appointment without contact me. this is very bad service.,Bhai log this is suvi, from Nagpur, Maharashtra,...Bro tv is all good no lags no nothing... Very good picture quality, good sound , and worth buying it if you are buying it for home use purposes.... All those glitches and lags are just because of wifi speed... In order to use this tv at high speed u must have high speed internet available or else for tv serial use it is all good go on with it ..,I have used mi and one plusPros1. Picture quality one plus is better2. Sound quality one is betterCons1. Lags heavily while changing ott and switch on / off. This too much annoying. Never expected this. Due to this sometime in the background last played will continue for few seconds. It spoiled entire mood and concept of good quality tv. Mi is much better there is not much lag.2. Remote design absolutely poor engineering remote design. It\\'s not handy to use, hold and stupid placement of keys in the remote made. Poor engineering design products. As compared mi is far better simple sleek and to the target.3. Time to switch on takes more than usual time.It\\'s honest review not filters,I purchased 43 inch tv and having best bezeless tv experience you will find in this price range. Premium built, video quality is simply awesome with Dolby audio.,Value for money💰!!!! Worth it!,I\\'ve got Internal Storage of 4GB and here is mentioned 8Gb of storage, can i know Why?,I bought this TV in April 2021 and it stopped working within a month. Okay that\\'s fine it can happen with any product right? It took almost 2 months to get a service guy, that\\'s also fine even though I had no entertainment at home because of the lockdown going on everywhere.All of sudden a service guy came like an angel and said I have to pay for the service as the board is burned it won\\'t comes under their warranty policy. Great!I have been using a VU tv for the past 4 years that too got damaged but replaced with a brand new TV twice without even any questions asked. It was my great mistake I thought OnePlus would provide Quality products and Quality services. They just su*k.,The TV is an okay-ish buy.Don\\'t come for the Brand here.I would happily suggest anyone to go with a Samsung or even Onida TV which does come at a nearby price point.The sound is low, but what to expect from a 20 Watt internal speaker.Even though it is back-lit with LED, there are certain points where you will not be able to see anything, it will be pitch black, while it should have been normal.And for the Game Mode, I used my PS4, XBOX ONE and Switch along with that. Played a couple of matches in Battlefield 1 and WWII. It reduces lag, but not upto a gaming level.The remote cannot start the tv all the time.It is slow when it comes to remote response, but that is only for the start up.But at this price point, what can one expect.And, at the time of writing this review, I had a serious issue a few days back, but the inputs from HDMI produced a grayscale output.I thought the TV was done for.But, it happens across all the OnePlus TV\\'s it seems.If anyone has the same issue, reset the entire TV.I wasted some time with Amazon and OnePlus Care by scheduling repair services.But it was no good.All in all, I love One Plus, despite the negative points stated, the above has 2 stars for Amazon and 1 for the TV.If you want to try this one, gladly you are welcome, but I would suggest you to try another brand, specifically well established ones like Samsung or Sony or TCL or Onida.,Picture quality not that much better but OK!  Sound quality is Good.,Gud display & audio output superb,Oneplus tv arrived my home todayIt very slim and price was also good. It was very slim and easy to handle.,I like one plus not china,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I bought this tv on October 2020 for 24,999/- 43 inch..It\\'s almost a year now I\\'m writing this review... Even after so many Negative Reviews....I placed order... On my own risk.... But ITS WORTH THE ORDER...Tv is Fine working well... As displayed... Ignore the negative reviews...Guy from Amazon mounted on wall ...wellGood sound quality... video quality.... Everything is good.,I\\'m really satisfied by 1 plus.Display quality is bestSound enough for a medium sized hallScreen mirroring works without laggingConsGoogle voice search delays by 4-5 seconds1plus connect isn\\'t so much interesting as it\\'s too much slowBluetooth we can\\'t connect our mobile but only tv with headset and Bluetooth speakerSo,don\\'t think of connecting mobile BluetoothOverallDisplay is awesomeSound quality niceBass average,I order the product on 28th july flash sale, it is worth for this price and good picture and sound quality,,Picture quality is amazing,I have been using the 43 inch Y Series for over a week now.Pros - love the black tones, the tv itself is very aesthetic, latest Android loaded, all frequently used apps/programs available in the tv, the remote is very sleek and is Bluetooth enabled, no need to point remote to tv, the delivery and installation services were very quick and efficient.Cons - the OS laga, the build quality does not feel great, plastic body, doesn\\'t work well with Alexa, sound quality is not great. The colours are not great either. Does not have different picture/colour modes. The biggest con for me is that it does not have adaptive display and gets too bright in low light while in standard settings.Overall - for the price of ₹22K - ₹23K the TV is totally worth buying. Remember that this is a budget tv. Premium TV\\'s are almost double the cost.,Value for money,Got it delivered on exact date and installation done next day. Loved the product better then mi and realme I guess.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Alright, here is the new One Plus TV 43Y. You can watch Unboxing on my you tube channel X:Plorer!.I have been using this tv since a week now.Here are some pros and cons of the tv,Pros: Price, yes being a Indian we always seek products which are best quality with affordable price, It fits well.#Gift: Yes, you get Alexa Dot with OnePlus 43Y and 55 U TVs. Who don\\'t like free stuff?#Picture Quality is super with baseless design of 88% of total view. Viewing angel will give you great experience.#Build Quality: I have been trying different TVs till now including Mi 55 inch, Iffalcon 43inch and other but trust me this One Plus is far ahead when it comes to design and quality material.Cons:#Sound: Yes it has 20wt output sound with Dolby Atmos but you won\\'t feel bass.#RAM: It has 1GB RAM with internal storage of 8GB out of which only around 4 GB is useful. This would make operation lit slow.#Andoid oxygen play: It\\'s hardly has watchable content and it\\'s too old as there is Patch wall.,Picture Quality & Sound Quality Is Up to Mark Blindly Go with it.,I have used it for only 1 day but my experience is awesome and I didn\\'t felt any laggy experience with the TV,Everything other than installation is remarkable,The TV\\'s voice assistant features are almost non-functional. Every time when I tried the voice command, the ongoing video/movie stuck. The picture and sound quality are not so great for a room of 100 sqft and there was a lot of glare even with less light in the room, tried all the suggestions on changing contrast/brightness etc., By looking at the hype, I expected a lot but this TV did not meet any of my expectations and left a disappointing experience.,too good!!!purchase without hasitation..only d problem is amazon late service n nothing else..,Love it ❤️,Amazing picture qualityDoesn\\'t lag, only lag found was during initial setup.20w Speaker with Dolby speakers does a great jobBezels are extremely less and gives a nice experience.OnePlus did a great job and does give a premium feel.Cons:Audio quality should be tweaked. No bass which is a huge disappointment.Alexa is not bundled, you need to add it separately during the purchase.@Amazon, when you mention that Alexa comes free with this purchase then make it bundled with the TV unit and do not ask Customers to add it separately during the purchase. Don\\'t expect the Customers to add it separately during the Flash sale. This is simply cheating on the Customers.,I don\\'t get the original bill with box. Kindly provide me a softcopy of my bill.,Sound quality is a bit poor remaining things are good,Delivery in time and  Installation was also in time overall good service,Apart from the screen size and the clarity and the sound ofcourse nothin in this is a Good buy..1)Technically challengedEvery time yo switch on the TV you need to have a separate network in which you connect it first then only you can connect it to your wifi.2) Pathetic Response timeIf incase you’re in a bad mood, then refrain from switching on this TV. Cuz it’s going to be like solving a puzzle what went wrong & what possibly can be right and after all of that the remote will give you a run which you never wanted.I can go on… but not worth my time.Just one thing if you think of buying CHEAP, you can opt for TCL instead but these are just junk covered with a shiny plastic and a good outlook.,Actually I went through all the comments and reviews, I was initially intersted in OnePlus but  after reading these reviews I got confused. Then I checked for other smart TVs and finally settled to purchase this OnePlus TV only because of the trust and experience I had on OnePlus products mainly mobile phones which me and my family are using.Believe me after receiving this TV I couldn\\'t understand why people are so critical about this !! It serves all the purpose very well.. all smart features are excellent, connectivity is so good.. picture quality and sound is absolutely fine and sufficient for me. People complaint about its picture & sound quality but I found it amazing.. I don\\'t expect any better clarity of picture than this TV.. and sound.. I couldn\\'t use it on more than 10% volume in my 100 sq ft room. Guys It\\'s just a TV, it could be bad, good or excellent.. for me it\\'s Excellent.. I am not looking for a wife here.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣And people who are being so critical about this TV, I don\\'t know what are they were expecting.. may be they are comparing this TV with a PVR screen, or its sound with a bose music system then definitely it\\'s a below expectation product for you, sorry for your loss.,Value for money,Worst service ever.... It\\'s just been 23 days tht we bought it. It was all working fine and all of a sudden it shut down and we were unable to switch it on that too no body touched it or did anything.. How can this happen??? Quite surprised. .  I\\'d tried calling oneplus customer care, they\\'re saying they won\\'t be able to replace it since we\\'d purchased it from amazon..  And this seems to be too hectic to hear...  What\\'s this amazon..  Never expected this... The quality of the service is pathetic..  Please don\\'t buy it from amazon for their eye catching offers.  It always good to go n buy from their own website( I feel so)... If I would have done that then I would have got a replacement atleast.....,I never expected from OnePlus,TV experience is with pictures quality and sound along with smart features1) picture quality - very poor2) sounds is okay but don\\'t bother as I have sound bar3) TV takes 15~20 sec to start.4) slow in operation like going back to previous series or jumping to other plateform.Slim and Very light weight but how does it matter as It will be hand on the wall.Final comments - Dont buy or at least see few videos in youtube before buying for experts comments.I was blind with OnePlus name and  mobile fan for past several years and now I will be sorry\\'for very long time.,Picture quality and sound quality is excellent,Biggest disappointment with this TV was that this TV doesn’t support 5ghz wifi bandwidth, it still supports the 2.4ghz. Which I realised after everything was setup.Overall the TV is good, picture quality is good not great but assuming the TV is for only Rs. 24000 I wasn’t expecting much.Sound again isn’t top notch but loud enough. You will have to customise the sound settings a bit or if you really want that sround sound kinda effect you may need to buy an additional sound bar.The remote connection is good, and everything else is fine.,Begel less is awesomeThat is a good in one plusGreater better,Oneplus is worth the money as always!,This TV at that Price Tag is really a competitor to many other brands.The Best points from this TV include- Smart Features- Minimal Bezel frame picture- Google Voice Assistant- Customer friendly settingsOne thing I wasn\\'t accepting from this is its sound. I used a Samsung Smart TV before this and its output itself sounded as if it was from a home theatre but the same output from Oneplus was pathetic. I even tried all their settings and features available. I then ordered a JBL Infinity home theatre only for the sound thing and then connected it over Bluetooth. It was then beautiful and perfect. But after a couple of days there was a lag between the TV sound output and that from the Home theatre. I then replaced the JBL thing from Amazon and to my surprise found out that even the next one had a similar issue after a couple of days.I\\'m still worried if the Bluetooth feature of Oneplus TV has an issue or just my specific piece. This review of mine doesn\\'t judge Oneplus TV at any side. It\\'s just my experience. Other than the Bluetooth lag at some times, everything is at it\\'s best and you can go for it without a second thought.,Having dark patches at the bottom edge of the screen. Asked for the replacement. Not the way, it was expected. Disappointed...Edit: After a week or so, got the tv replaced. This one piece is OK and thanks to the tech team listening and addressed the issue as early as possible.Still I have some issue, why the bluetooth once paired (for speaker) doesn\\'t stay forever? Every time, I had to unpair and pair the bluetooth after switching off and on the tv. It\\'s so irritating 😡😡😡😡😡Rest I\\'m ok with the it.😓😓,This has some issues! It was slow since the day I bought it.  I had read that  this is the way it is designed it is a slow tv.  Fine by me I bought it like a dumb a.. now after few months it stucks! Manufacturing defects were never considered and repaired before a launch! Go for it on your own risk.Ps:- risking isn\\'t worth on this one..Go sky diving If you wanna risk so much. 😂,Overall meets the expectations at this price,Good for the price you pay. Software is buggy but nothing\\'s deal breaking here.Picture Quality: Its Decent. Slim bezels. You\\'ll find backlit led bleeding in on the side. Overall it\\'s a good quality (for what you pay)Audio: Its hard to hear dialogues in the movies. Ull be needing a decent external speakers for sure.,The TV looks really good with thin bezels.,this TV has some serious software issue, until or unless they rectify the issue i would not recommend this TV. but yah i hope it can be resolved by a software update (takes time more than 5 month i guess).Software issues:1. when unboxed it was fine after some days, the software is getting lag .2. the screen is getting Fully RED sometimes (like the display has damaged), but after restart or re-set the TV, it is  getting normalized.* Picture Quality is not too awesome but yah if you could adjust the Picture settings its nice(but not awesome)Good aspects:1. the Remote is awesome , if you connect it with bluetooth its damn good. if it\\'s not its bit laggy.2. if you are watching the cable/dish, you don\\'t need to change the input always (to HDMI/composite) it will read  the last input when you switch back on.3. oneplus connect is working fine , but yah its laggy, you can change the below steps  #movements (left right up down and select)  #change the inputs (hdmi composite..)  #back button4. google voice is working fine (can open the apps .. download.. etc...)5. the TV sound is great not a dolby one but yah its good.Bad aspects :1. not able to connect with Alexa(Echo Dot 3rd gen) i have checked with the service team they told its might be a  software issue. and they also told they will sent a guy to resolve this (*technichal guy is not yet came)2. some time the screen is getting Fully Red, got resolved after re-setting , its irritating sometimes to re-set the  TV again and again.3. while purchasing the TV, the Alexa(Echo dot 3rd gen its not free, i have checked with the Amazon, they told its  not free anymore)4. wall mount is not with the TV. we have to purchase it from the Amazon technical guy and cost is around 1500/-  (better to purchase it separately )* there is 2 aspects to start TV.1. when unplugged and re-plug it its taking  around 30 sec to completely start the TV2. plugged and switch off from remote and switch on from the remote again, its taking around 10 secconclusion:wont recommend to purchase now, might be after resolving it by an software update (might be take some month i guess)after 3 months of usage:1.TV is getting stuck sometimes, need to unplug and replug to start working again2.sometimes composite mode is not working (only shows blue background for 10 sec and comes back to home page),Hi team,I bought this tv around 2months back and getting wifi issue and remote control problem from day and open a case with support team, its been a 2 month till now no resolution.Chasing care from oneplus care app, Twitter, whatsApp, mail support but no resolution. I don\\'t know when can I get resolution. After 10months my warranty period will be over, I dnt have hopes.Please think before you buy.This is my personal experience. Iam not enforcing anyone.This is after 90days , I opened a ticket 2months back but till now there is no resolution. Customer care guys just closing the ticket and asking feedback, there main focus is on feedback not on resolution.Other side I escalated to Amazon still there is no resolution.  I don\\'t know when I can get resolution,I bought this TV from Amazon. After 6 months, one fine day, I couldn\\'t turn on the TV. Since I have paid for extra warranty, I contacted Amazon for technical support. I scheduled the appointment 4 times. Every time the technician didn\\'t turn up and they reschedule it. I was contacting OnePlus as well, nobody visited or tried to resolve the issue, and keep on sending automated replies. Now it\\'s been nearly 4 months and still its not resolved.,I have bought this TV in August 2020. I have started facing lag, glitches, screen freeze since Feb 2021. Since then it\\'s been 20-30 calls to customer care , 10 service schedules and on hold status. You will not get any help from Amazon or Qdigi (one plus partner). It\\'s a bad launch. I can\\'t describe the months of harassment by Amazon and One plus to finally telling me that My warranty is over now in August and no further help can be done without actually resolving anything.,First I received this product with a different stand and they send a replacement for this. All this process took around 1 month. Finally, I got a working product.After using it for 6 months, we were watching the TV suddenly it stopped working. I raised a complaint immediately. I waited for few days and started calling customer care. Every day, the phone will be attending by different executives they will tell theirs on stories. It will be assigned to Technician or the call with escalated to you will get a call back so and so... After a month and half the complaint got assigned to a technician and without visiting the site they told they have ordered for parts.During all this time, we were using our old TV. Good that we haven\\'t sold.At last, they came the home with a TV and exchanged some parts with our TV. The TV is working.. but one issue. The TV display is coming opposite side. If we rotate the TV only we will be able to see. Now they told me there are no settings in the remote to change the direction. They will come with software to resolve this issue.  Again the service person came and tried to fix it but still, it\\'s not resolved.Now they want to take the TV to service place and we have to get it from there. Not sure how much time it will take.This is my experience with the OnePlus TV. I would suggest don\\'t go for this product.. If you still want to buy then arrange an alternative and be ready.,I think that I should have bought Mi 4X instead of this but the 43inch of Mi 4X was not available on Amazon and I don\\'t like to buy from Flipkart!1) This OnePlus TV has lot of lag issues, since it has only 1gb of ram the optimization is poor2) the sound is not good at all, for a room it is okay but after 50% volume, don\\'t know if volume even increases, instead the effect increases which compromises the quality of sound. I recommend buying a soundbar3) does not power on by single click from remote. Some issue with that4) doesn\\'t have new features like multicast,Only buy it if you\\'re a OnePlus fan, otherwise Go for Mi 4X instead, that provides 4K and better optimized performance,Low quality product, bought in first sale. Sound quality is so poor. Returned after few days.,:: Honest review Let me write one by one ::  (Review after 2 weeks)  First of all I have pre-booked Oneplus Y43 and availed the acko’s 2 years extended warranty,And  also Amazon ECHO DOT along with this TVWhich is worth to buy at 23K..!! (Those who have missed Echo Dot, I feel very sorry for them)Also Alexa worked me as a smart connector between TV and my Sony home theatre system, without any digital cables or converters ..! Saved my money there too..!!1. Picture Quality : Is pretty good and 1080i LED display. Viewing angle should be straight and if it’s more than 30degree picture clarity will reduce and colours starts fading. Make sure you are straight infront of TV view.2. Sound Quality : is ok kind of Quality at this price as I am depending more on home theatre speakers, thus it’s good for me.3. Value for money : yes definitely you can choose at this budget unless like other brands of this range and it’s 43”.5.chromecasting is built-in, can avail from IOs platform too as I am using it..!4. Includes all the modern smart tv features like Netflix, amazon,YouTube and google assistants in one single button. But some time-lag can be experienced while changing the input sources.Even google assistance is bit slow to catch-up when compared to Alexa..!Overall I can give  ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️Thanks Team Oneplus and Amazon.in,Pros:Contrast Ratio is Amazing.Black level is amazing.Viewing angles are fine.Awesome Color accuracy.Latest Android version.Cons:Poor quality Speakers.Little bit lag, probably the OS.As for speakers, why would you use inbuilt speakers?What matters most is Contrast Ratio, Color range, viewing angles, and clarity.Bit Over PricingAMAZON INSTALLATION:Installation has not completed, Waited for 28 days, Then done with local technician.Amazon Service is getting poorer.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Google assistant is not working properly 😒,Smartest smart tv from oneplus..in this price range no other TV\\'s has such picture quality and features..its totally premium product..just one thing pls buy soundbar or any sound system with this..this tv has dolby digital, dolby digital plus, surround sound...which are awesome functions indeed but u can feel these features only if u have external sound system . Else the speakers of 10w each are very low in volume..a good movie with sound effects cant be enjoyed at all..else this tv is highly recommended. All the features works perfectly as the company says in ads. Value for money indeed.One update after using the tv for 1.5 month-1. Never faced problems like auto restart, lags, etc. But yes if u install loads of apps then u should wait few seconds when u start the tv else u will see lil lags..but after few seconds it will run smoothly..,TV works fine. Features are also impressive. But the rigidity of the TV is questionable.Installation Service by One Plus was very poor. The installation was scheduled between 2-6pm and they reached around 6.30pm and left around 8.45pm. The Fixed wall mount used was in rusted condition. And they drilled total 5 holes on the TV Mounting board for 4 screw!! and the Wooden board got damaged. The TV was tilted to one side after installation and then they had to use small paper pieces to level the TV ! For the fixed TV mount the charge was rs 500 even though the charge written in amazon is rs 299 for a 43\" TV!!,By comparing with my friend MI TV, oneplus is very bad. The picture quality and sound quality is very poor comparing with his TV. The remote control and voice recognition is perfect. But the clarity of display is very bad according to MI TV. Till the reviewing date there is no inbuilt apps for screen casting,etc. We should seperatly want to download Airscreen app from play store. For installing other apps this TV not have file manager to download apk from USB, we should also want to download that from play store. I am damn sure that My friends MI TV is better than oneplus TV. My rating to this TV is 2.5/5.Not worth this TV for 12,999.better go for MI tv or other brands like tcl, realme, etc. I think that Oneplus will overall these products, but in case of TV till I am putting the review MI TV is good by comparing with my friends TV.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0This review is in usage of 9 months. Worst product from OnePlus. I just don\\'t even understand why they had to come into TV. My personal opinion always go with Sony or LG. It is the best.2nd time issue with the display.First issue arrived after 4 months I bought the TV. Same as you see in the picture. (This image is second time issue)But it was working for 30 mins and it started to fade away. I usually don\\'t use the TV much so I didn\\'t care about it for 2 months. Then it started to fade forever. So had to book a service. Nonsense in this pandemic. It took 2 months to fix.Fine atleast some picture to see in the second lockdown after the service. And it didn\\'t like to work after 1 month after the 1st service. Same kind of issue. This image is reference after 1st service done to display. (Changing the whole display).I personally recommend Sony of LG. They are best in TVs. Ofcourse they are high priced for what reason you guys might think. This is the reason.These guys, I just don\\'t understand why did I even step foot in these kinds of company\\'s for a different product. They are utter waste of time and money. I have used the TV only for 6 months. That\\'s it.And I\\'m in second services with one year.Bullshit what others think about this TV or the brand. Shame to say I\\'m oneplus user for 7 years now.Cheap quality displays they use. So is the lowest price.,Amazing product got it for 12k. A ton of features added .,Pixel quality is ok. You can easily notice it with different colours. Using android enabled smart tv hence have same emotions like the way android works or probably the function processing capability of the tv is not at par. Tv Remote sensor works only in you are in range of 2 metres irrespective of inserting battery cells. I feel my Tata sky remote sensor was out of the world since it use to capture signals from any corner of the room where my old tv was installed.Piece of advise if you money to spend go for another brand or device altogether and you limited on budget I would recommend you to with this tv,Amazing picture and sound quality 🔥,Superb awesome tv must buy it. Go for it..Thnsk #oneplus,I have bought 32\" version of this series TV. There was network connection issue. while I troubleshoot found that date and time was set as 9Sep2020 every time we switch ON the TV. Because of this internet connection through our wifi router is not connected even though other devices get connected with same wifi network. When I do the warranty claim, after three or four visits, either Oneplus or authorized service personal(Amazon itself) cannot find the solution. So every time we switch ON TV we need to set date and time for proper internet connectivity. Otherwise it will work like a normal LED TV only not smart TV. You cannot use any app installed or you cannot install any new apps. Think before buying this TV as this involves big risk. I am writing this review after using the TV for last one month. No response for replacement from either side.,Best product at this price,The best in this price segment 👍👍👍👍😍😍😍😍,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Awesome quality product.,Everything is perfect. You can go for it.,. Very bad service . Please go with Sony or Samsung . One plus Service is very bad if your tv is under warranty you have to pay for the any problem . I bought this before 3 month ago but now the bubbling issue is appearing on the screen . I called customer care they accepted that it’s under warranty but after 15 days they asked me for 11 k .,Waiting for the installation !,From Starting Day Of Purchase I\\'m getting Issue... With TV but Nothing Happened... Neither did solve with Amazon customer care nor with Onplus customer care ....Still I am Helpess worst TV Ever... Scene From starting day... Issue is coming Displayed Showing Black And White.... USB Does not supporting.... Any Pendrive.... Any app if opening it\\'s taking 5 second To Open... So much of Lagging Issue... From starting day... The 64 Bit... It not look it\\'s supporting at all... 1 GB of ram Is still low....  I guess...Amazon Told Again Happened they will replaced the TV But After 10 days Policy.  They assured that After Third Technical Support My Policy was Going... They said Don\\'t worry... You Will get replacement If This Happened again... Now All issue I am facing Neither Amazon Can\\'t do... Or Not One Plus Service... Is Doing...Amazon Worst ever.... (Mr. Jeff Bezos)  & (Amit Agarwal),I am quite Happy with the product... Weightless TV..Great job by One Plus,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0It\\'s hardly one month and the TV is unusable. Volume keeps increasing and screen flickers to the bottom.Cannot control the TV through remote.  Reached out to customer care and the response very slow.Update 6/sep.Customer care replaced the remote and it did not solve the issue.More than a month that I raised a complaint and the problem still exists.PATHETIC SUPPORT.Amazon just keeps escalating the issue without resolution.,Awesome tv,Avoid buying this tv. It\\'s seems cheap but so is the performance. I bought this tv one week back and in this one week I have faced the following problems on:- tv has hung/frozen four times- audio was on but video was completely blanked out once- lag when bluetooth headphone is connected and the audio breaks- replacement cannot be done until service centre guy checks it- service centre person never turns up despite multiple follow-ups. Raised the issue with Amazon on 27th and still waiting for some service centre person to pick my call and attend to the problemDissapointing,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Very good TV,Excellent picture quality. Perfect for a common man\\'s middle class family.,Perfect as per expectations..,Never thought I will have to write a negative feedback for OnePlus products.We insisted our parents to buy this TV and we are regretting it.The TV constantly hangs and everytime we ask for a return or for replacement of the product, a technician is been appointed to check the TV.I really don\\'t know how to sync the timing of technician and the time when TV hangs to be at the same time...Really disappointed by the product and also by Amazon because I still don\\'t have any clarity whether or not there is going to be replacement or refund or not...Requesting Amazon to kindly provide the relevant information and solve the grevieneces of geneiue customers.Note I have called Amazon customer service for atleast 3 timesAwaiting a positive response from Amazon,I installation not done properly , I have registered my complaintSound is not great, buy vu cinema tv for good soundPicture quality is goodUI is goodRemote is good clutter free ,simple , cute .After using for one month now there is display issues ..I am really not happy with oneplus purchase,Lags a lot, Sony home theatre connected to the TV worked fine for the first month but post some software update started to face too many issues, home theatre not getting recognised, remote issue the one plus customer service is very bad they take weeks to respond. They are yet to come and check what the issue is.Bought the TV on the first day it was launched but regrett now very upsetting experience.,Worth the money and the quality is splendid!,Awesome,The remote stopped working it isnt damaged by any means I don\\'t know now how to use the TV as nothing can work without remote so useless product as expected from China 😡,There is a lot of lag while operating the tv with remote. To switch on the tv, I need to try Atleast 10 times. And if it still does not work, I need to manually switch on the tv by pressing the button behind TV. I really like the One Plus brand but, TV definitely is not up to the mark. Can\\'t handle the lag sometimes. It\\'s very frustrating after paying so much money and can\\'t do anything when the remote does not work. I\\'m sure I definitely can use connect feature on my One Plus mobile phone as remote, but what\\'s the TV remote for when it does not do what it is supposed to do.,Giving review after 1 month of usage. One of the worst TV\\'s I have ever seen. Avg display, Avg sound. Doesn\\'t switch on as soon as I power on from the remote, need to press at least 2-3 times to switch on TV.  There\\'s a lot of lag for volume buttons. Sometimes TV itself goes to home page from live TV and doesn\\'t go back to live TV, need to switch off TV and switch it on again. After 1 month of usage TV hanged up a few times. The TV even doesn\\'t connect to OnePlus connect app. Need to find TV on mobileapp for so much time, sometimes even after many trails I can\\'t connect to my TV. Even opening and closing apps is very laaagggggyyyyy.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Very nice 👍👌👍👌👍,I bought this TV based on my experience with One plus Phone. Contrary to the quality of the phones, the TV quailty has proven to be nightmare for me. On top of that their service is poor. The option to register complaint through Amazon gives no result. 1st the display was not proper, after complaining they took two months to change the display. The new display lasted only 10 days and now its completely black screen with few colored lines. Its been 10 days, I have raised complaint to both Amazon and One plus directly but all in vain. I will not recommended this TV to anyone. I have two more TVs at my home (both Samsung), never faced any such issue. Samsung has the same price and same features. I wish I can replace it for Samsung.....and now its the third time that the TV is down, 3rd time in warranty period,Just today the installation guy came and install the tv perfectly1st glanaceThis is almost an bezel less tv I cannot expect much in this price but the design is quite stylishSecondly it took some time for start at first timeBut then after it is smooth.2nd galanceAfter completed all the setups on tv for its specs 1gb ram it is super smooth no doubt there is an delay of 3 to 4 seconds but that ok as tv used frequently then that delays also minimises3rd glanaceThe sound is grt for this price point. it\\'s not that you purchase a tv under 23k and ten compared it with 50k tv that\\'s unfair but the tv comes with Dolby atoms + and Dolby Atmos both features for sound4th finaleLastly Google assistant works pretty well with this tv too it response time is in milliseconds,Impressed with the product quality and design, performance is also decent, video quality is quiet good, audio not up to the expectations, terrible installation service, technician never contacted even after 14 days from the delivery date, contacted amazon many times, had to reschedule 3 times, canceled the service at last.,Like the title of my review said, I am going to only list down the factual pros and cons after a day of using the TV elaborately and let you decide for yourself.Pros-Great picture quality, especially if content is in HD-The smart TV features that allows you to pair it with your phone, laptop, bluetooth speakers, bluetooth headphones, etc. are super handy-The screen size of 43\" is just perfect for your room unless it is ultra spaciousCons-The sound. 20W is loud enough, but the quality is really poor and one-dimensional so you will surely need an external sound system or sowaker-The finishing of the product is not the best. One can tell how OnePlus managed to price this at 25k when you pay attention to how they\\'ve cut corners on the quality. The OnePlus logo on the front is titled (first time I\\'ve ever seen this on a product from a reputed brand). There\\'s a considerable gap between the display and top corner bezels, and the plastic finishing isn\\'t even-There\\'s a lag when you\\'re operating the TV (switching between apps, browsing content, and giving Google assistant voice commands) 50% of the time. Hoping OnePlus fixes it with future software updates but so far there\\'s no official word on thatThose are my pros and cons in a nutshell, now the decision is yours,Hello,Please do not buy TV from online...because I bought one plus TV on June 20th, within 2 months display went off..after that I am trying  for warranty claim...but it\\'s been 10 days still no one from Amazon responding properly...I don\\'t know when issue will be resolved...so better go to local vendor and buy electronic items..atleast we can ask that guy if any problem occurs ...,I like vry much,I bought this TV in pre booking. The TV quality is adequate, there is nothing good about it.After 6 months my TV face an issue where HDMI ports were non-functional, it has been 30 days yet, I complained both Amazon and OnePlus for the warranty but both are unable to repair it because of scarcity of parts.OnePlus is not the same brand it used to be, the products are pathetic and sub standard.,Nice TV,As far as display and sound is concerned, the tv is a good buy.But the tv lags very much. The processor isn\\'t that powerful. I don\\'t know how at the launch time the demos work so fine.Navigating between sources,apps, volume control is very laggy.Switching tv on is very tricky. Sometimes it takes 10+ button clicks to turn on tv.This issue is same with Mi TVs as well.,The output of video quality is really good.But, the TV lags very oftenly.Major manufacturing problem in all y series 43inch television is with HDMI port 2. The screen keeps flickering or goes blank for 2-3seconds if connected to HDMI2. Tried with different devices in HDMI2 port to confirm the issue.I got the TV replaced. But the same error again persists even with the replacement TV.Hence, it\\'s confirmed that there is some manufacturing deffect with this model of television.,Great product.,Value for money, go for it,Reviewing after using the product for a month.*Picture quality is awesome. It will beat many other competitors in this price range but not that great as boasted in the launch event.*Sound Quality is average. But you have to make some changes in the settings to get a good sound output. But compared to Motorola and realme tv in this price range, it\\'ll lose. In this TV to get a good sound output, you have to max the volume.*Software is the point where I got disappointed from one plus. I expected many things because it\\'s a TV from Oneplus. The TV lags a little bit. Control from the TV remote takes 1-2 seconds for the TV to operate. I hope one plus gives a good proper update to clear this problem.*Ram is 1gb and the storage is 8gb out of which the available is 3.6gb. Motorola has 4.6gb of free space. So a little disappointment but it\\'s a TV after all not a smartphone.* Input ports works fine and u won\\'t get a 3.5mm port.*Opening an app takes some time which is a little irritating.*As said about the Oneplus connect app, it\\'s not that hype what you saw during the launch event. One annoying thing is you have to open a oneplus connect app from the TV and then you can use it from your smartphone. Typing option is not available.* Sometimes the TV doesn\\'t open YouTube. Have to restart the TV and then open YouTube.If Oneplus is seeing this Review I expect you to solve the software issue regarding the lag which annoys a lotOne more thing I couldn\\'t connect Alexa to this TV.Also I couldn\\'t connect Google remote.Overall it\\'s a good budget TV. But it\\'s not that buttery smooth. If the software issue is solved then this TV will be a great budget TV.I hope my review helps you.,Amazing,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0पिक्चर क्वालिटी शानदार हैं, साउंड बहुत ही शानदार हैं,टाटा स्काई hd वाला लगाइये बेहतरीन क्वालिटी हैं, यू ट्यूब अन्य एंड्राइड एप्प बहुत अच्छे से चलते हैं आप इसे आराम से. ले सकते हैं मुझे तो बहुत पसंद आया मै बहुत सारे टीवी देखने के बाद इसको चयन किया, और मुझे खुशी हुई की ये एंड्राइड टीवी लिया जो बहुत ही शानदार हैं, अमेज़ॉन अपने ग्राहकों को कभी निराश नहीं करता, धन्यवाद अमेज़ॉन,Best Quality product at a cheap price,Amazing as it should be.,Nice tv under 13k,Got a faulty remote straight out of the box, with neither OnePlus nor Amazon taking responsibility and both asking me to approach the other. As a manufacturer, OnePlus should ideally honour warranty replacements especially when the product is less than 24 hours old and faulty right out. If you\\'re buying this, be warned that OnePlus support is super apathetic and you\\'ll probably be left fending for yourself.TV is fine(ish) as a product, nothing exceptional. It\\'s rife with software bugs and lags -- can\\'t even download apps because they all get stuck on \"pending\". Go for an Amazon FireTV, a non-smart TV with a fire stick, an Apple TV, or just assemble one yourself - you\\'ll have a better experience than with this garbage product and company.,👍🏼,This has been one hell of a let down - it isnt a bad TV but something about it that leaves me disappointed. I have had many TVs, Sony, LG, Mi, Vu - they have all add something to vow. This one comes out as very ordinary. But if you are burying it, its not the TV that will bother you - its the service. Its been 2 weeks since I raised a complaint, they have done nothing about it. Tweeting, calling, mailing - nothing has worked!! So my advise - look for someone who respects your business.,Excellent,The tv i bought is not worth.Its too damn slow. It starts and switches off on own.Installation was not proper may be.Even after resetting everything the tv works on its own n is very damn slow.Voice commands does not work.,Review after a week:Pros:1. Less Bezel, not Bezel less.2. Screen quality is okay for the price range.Cons:1. Muffled audio. No bass. Not even B of Bass.2. Software glitches. Remote response time is slow.3. Color reproduction not accurate.4. No IR for remote.5. Cheap material.A mediocre at best product from OnePlus.,Overall best Tv,I got this tv on 16 August and installation was done on 28 August. After using for 1 day i noticed some problem in the display. There were some black and white spots on the screen when the screen comes to white colour. In my opinion this tv is worst ever. Sound quality is also poor and picture quality is ok...overall my experience is not good and i will not recommend to buy this OnePlus TV.,Very nice,First of all, the TV is very slow and takes minutes to switch on and respond to the remote. Once I press the Google button to use voice search, the TV just becomes so stuck and stays like that for minutes. It also randomly get switched off while watching.Because of these complaints, I raised a service request and it has been a month and no action action taken yet. Now, the TV is failing to get connected to WiFi as well.This is by far, the worst purchase from Amazon. I am a regular Amazon customer and never expected to get cheated like this. So please don\\'t buy this TV and get into trouble like me.,bought this tv in Sept , in the first week only it started saying connected but no internet. at first i thought some network issues, but later figured out all other devices were working fine only this TV has the problem. that time i placed for a service request also that guy came and reset the whole TV and it became alright.. i thought some small glitch after that a few days later it again happend and i reset and added all the apps again...this kept on happening till date and abt 20days the service incharge came an checked. as soon as he saw he said its a problem with the board and he will raise a request for replacement for the board in 7 working days and slipped away.. i waited  and after a few days called him n he is washing his hands away saying he cannot do much abt it and will have to check with Amazon... the great Amazon has escaleted the issue 3 times n till date nothing has happend..@amazonIndia ur cheats , today i m trying to call and my call is only getting sent from pillar to post..people oneplus -the great chinese and great amazon are trying to fool people.. dont trust this TV or any other devices they only now how to cheat people and take people for a ride... never ever will buy anything from Amazon, worst customer care.. shut shop and go,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I am writing this review after 4 days of useI was excited for the one plus tv as I have 4 OnePlus devices in my home and I am extremely satisfied with all of then .But as soon as the TV got installed I noticed that the App icons in the onelus UI were blur( I could see the pixels distorted). I asked the the installation guy if it was some settings issue. He tried to fix it and said that it is like that onlyI compared it with my other FHD TV( MI 4A pro) and there was a major difference.* after 2 days the OS started lagging very much* Startup takes minimum 30 sec* The voice recognition is very bad* The Chromecast is worse ( it lags as hell that you can\\'t even understand a single word)* Chromecast keep failing when tried to connect with laptop*The OnePlus connect app has a 5 sec delay* The picture quality is that bad You can see the screen distorting in wallpapers.Even after so many defects both Amazon and Oneplus has declined my refund saying that it is a quality issue and no refund would be provided for the same.,I have purchased this TV in August 2020 and after just one month of purchasing its display suddenly stopped working. When I made complaint in amazon because product is in warranty period so zero services provided from Amazon\\'s side as well as one plus now its been more than 7 months and none of the technician came at my place. For this thing when I escalated issues even on Twitter as well amazon said contact the one plus directly we can not help. So, till now Nothing is done in this case and after August they will say product is not in Warranty period. So, guys  I now i will not buy any of the one plus product and recommend the same to you as well. This is my story which I thought to share with you if in case you are planning to buy any of the one plus product,I am using this tv now since last 25 days. I find it very good. Pictire quality is excellent as well as the sound quality. You just need to make the settings right. There are various options in settings. Very elegant look. May be smallest size in 32 inch segment.There are few negative review about it\\'s panel quality on YouTube, which is deliberately made by one reviewer it seems. All other experts have appraised this product.ConsThakes few seconds to load as 32 inch tv mostly comes with 1gb ram. But this is okOne major concern is screen mirroring from mobile, which is really slow. App cast has no issue.Overall it\\'s a very good product.,Worrest product and worrest service don\\'t buy it is a one plus tv but local quality and not manufacturer one plus manufacturer in hyderabad local company and assembled and I bought July 15 and worked 15 days after apps not installed and not updated after tv screen black.so i am complaint to amazon they till resolved my issue till date.and there is no one plus customer care service centers and very difficult contact one plus customer care and they not respond one plus tv service done by amazon service persons only.tgis is not brand so don\\'t buy waste of money and time .Take brand tv and good service available.very bad experience in this tv i have faced amazon people also very irregular service with in two months i have two major issues in tv ine is mother board and tv screen.tq please check every one mafacture details in tv box shocked....tq,It\\'s good and worth too,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Very worst company and very bad customer support....I have purchased this one plus 32y tv on 8 july20 and tv display has gone on 16 Aug 20....I have complained and talk to many times to amazon and one plus care they only send technicians for visit...I m writing this review after 10 days from complaint date and still they are saying that due to unavailable of parts i am not able to repair your tv....they are just making fool to Indian user....pls don\\'t buy and don\\'t suggest to any one....,The Product came faulty out of the box. Within two months of purchase there were visible lines and blacked out picture when connected to a set top box.So finally one day the product decided to quit with no picture but just RGB lines on display. See for the details in shared pic.Now coming to the service part. It\\'s been almost 3months since I am trying to get it serviced or repaired by Amazon(product support agency). Well it is a new year now still no luck.The customer care executives are a bunch of fools with no remors of your problem. Their constant jab is wait for 48hrs problem will be resolved. They provide you with all sorts of misinformation regarding their product support. One told me it will be fulfilled by ONEPLUS,Honestly oneplus don\\'t give a flying duck\\' about customer or later in product support. With multiple calls and false promises, I called back Amazon Cs, this is when I came to know the product and service will be done by Amazon. Anyway after multiple calls and escalations till date no one visited. An engineer was scheduled to visit while he didn\\'t and contacted me via call and asked me to click picture of the problem and send me via whatsapp. After looking upon it he told me it\\'s a manufacturing defect and will be replaced at the earliest. Well later received a mail from Amazon stating support has been cancelled.So the moral of the story is,THE STRUGGLE IS REAL.Purchase One plus at your own risk.Don\\'t trust Amazon for any service related query.,Very good picture quality enjoying watching movies. Sound quality require some improvement. Easy to connect with app. Very good installation service.Lots of one start in review are due to not getting Alexa offer and faulty products and installation service.Regarding Alexa they mentioned it\\'s free or on less price but as there routine offer it\\'s not kept easily available u have to check and add offer in u r cart which is not expected from amazon. It heart\\'s if you buy product and not got offered Alexa. So my sincere request to amazon if u are willing to give any offer keep it easy and don\\'t hide it. Else didn\\'t give what we are getting in this price One ➕ Tv we are happy.Thanks,Worst tv experience that I have ever had , in my life with this TV, worst customer service experience and service .Amazon kept the promise of contacting the manufacturer , which was to harsh for a month old TV, TV had bad screen issue remote issue .waiting for the drama to get over from the one plus side,1. Screen Flickering is the most common problem2. Half of the times, TV doesn\\'t start with a single button press by the remote.3. Booting takes at-least 30 seconds4. Screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time.5. System lag is the maximum in this class of TV\\'s.6. Most of the Apps doesn\\'t work which is downloaded from playstore.7. Youtube Apps crashes many times.8. Airtel Extreme doesn\\'t work.9 Picture quality doesn\\'t beyond 1080p, even if play the 4K video.Overall the bad experience which is never expected from the brand like OnePlus.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Don\\'t buy OnePlus TV I Bought OnePlus y series 43 in\" tv with in one and half month tv screen problem, I search technician In chennai , vellore, and kanchipuramNot available in 3 district , then I realised total tamilnadu technician not availableLocal service man told that you complaint register to  customer care then he will guide you like that,My first complaint registered  sep18th 2021Still 7 to 8 times following for recovery of complaintBut more than 2 month completed still my tv problem not solvedSo don\\'t buy OnePlus tv,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I bought OnePlus 32 Y series smart TV on 16 Sep 2020 and during the initial usage I felt like this was the best grab for the price because Oneplus gives its superior build quality and smart features and everything seems to be fine for first 2 months.Literally everything was good .But after two months of usage the TV suddenly started showing display issues , such as change in colour , flickering etc and this issue disappears when the TV is  RESTARTED . Again this issue started appearing on random basis and goes when restarted.So when this happened multiple times I myself recorded a video and pictures  of the same and contacted amazon for the service.Believe me this is where it all started to become worser. The technician visited my home and confirmed it that the TV is having manufacturing defect as it doesn\\'t have any physical damage.From then it almost took 2 months of continued followup with amazon customer care to solve my issue. The issue was escalated multiple time and still was not resolved. I talked with superior associate still they also couldn\\'t solve my issue ,at last after multiple complaints and escalation on priority basis and to management level , they had to accept the return as an exception.OnePlus brand didn\\'t meet the expectations in its TV.,Good,I thought that oneplus name might have a good quality product for TV like mobiles, but they failed..After the purchase of TV with in a month the remote stopped working and when raised a issue with Oneplus customer care they sent a service person and he confirmed me that the remote is faulty and will be replaced with a new one, But after 90 days of complaint registered still they haven\\'t provided a remote  all they do is close the ticket after few days and asked to open a new one for the same complaint.They say that they don\\'t have a spare remote and this is the response from ONE PLUS CUSTOMER CARE and they don\\'t know when they might have it. 90+ days without remote that too on the early days after the TV lauch.They are not good with service all they are good with one time sales. WORST support in the industry.,Brand new One plus TVs are having issues with Bluetooth connectivity. I have observed this issue after the return window is over. Else could have returned it. One plus being such a reputed company this is not great on their part. Looks like they are now compromising on the quality to bring the prices down to compete with the like of other Chinese players. Bad experience. I would recommend to go for established brands such as LG, Samsung, Panasonic, etc,TV hangs randomly. Have to switch it completely off at least once a day and switch on again. The apps malfunction. Netflix exits on its own. Sometimes YouTube opens when we hit the Netflix button on the remote. Remote connectivity is also not fool proof. Sometimes it gets stuck while fast forwarding.To connect to different bluetooth device have to disconnect from the current one as there is no option to scan when connected to a device already.The tv has most features but they will malfunction sometimesVoice recognition doesn\\'t work,This tv takes so much time to get start...since we bought this it is having an issue with start up and sudden switch off issue. But we did not get the replacement. Even the amazon is not helping in this and says we don\\'t have policy for the return of the product. Why it should not be returnable on a day one.,Good,I just have a single suggestion. Don\\'t go for it. I ignored the reviews while purchasing the product stating there are lot of glitch in the tv software. I thought those glitches would go after the update. But it didn\\'t happen. The tv has lot of problems. It started from day 1.Problems with product:1. Youtube and other apps crashes all of the sudden.2. Volume key most of the times doesn\\'t work.3. Tv doesn\\'t respond to the remote almost all the time.4. Chromecast doesn\\'t work. Pros:1. Picture quality is average.2. Sound quality is good.3. Tv build up quality is good.,Plz dont purchase this specific product with amazone because of customer service center not provide you priority service because of you are amazons customer not OnePlus brand\\'s . So i m suggesting purchase threw brand so thet will give you proper service. After delivery of my tv i m getting my installation after 15 days . And now i want to claim warranty because of product issue with internet connectivity so now one plus customer care executive not replying me properly and Amazon customer service dont do anything because of warranty given by one plus not amazone .,Pathetic TV, It does not connect to the sony 5.1 music system, the guy who came was just in a hurry to fix it and run, did not clearly explain things and did not give solution to connect the home theatre despite asking him...Day 2 it is not detecting set top box even though the hdmi is plugged in properly...having a tough time with the tv...the biggest mistake in my life was to go for this TV....I will give ZERO STARS FOR THIS PRODUCT.Suggestion - Spend a little more and get a better established television brand,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0This TV is not great or not worst.I liked the picture quality in this range and bezel less view is awesome.(attached picture)However, not having aux support is minus. Sound quality of TV is poor. Poor and loud sound doesn\\'t help.And recently I\\'ve found a dead pixel on the screen, of which I\\'ve attached the picture. Technician came and checked it. Received an update saying waiting for warranty part. Will update how everything went once anything is done.Updating on 30/10/2020-> Received replacement part-> Received part was replaced to TV with original one-> Executive messed it up and TV is not showing true colors now. To say it is showing negative like colors-> Looking trust on amazon day by day.->Chatted with agent called Seizel who is stubborn and not at all listening.-> Rescheduled a service appointment.-> Will see what will happen and update here.Will not recommend this product strongly. Overall so so experience.,Like the TV overall. Good picture quality and software interface. I would recommend it. However, I feel the following could have been done differently:1. The sound quality isn\\'t all that impressive. The speakers aren\\'t loud enough. I\\'m using additional speakers with my TV.2. The processor used is quite slow. I see apps hanging at times which forces me to reboot the TV.3. The setup process wasn\\'t very smooth. When I first started the TV, I couldn\\'t install or update apps. I had to reset the TV to get the play store working.4. I can\\'t find a way to boot the TV to the home screen. It directly boots to the live TV interface. I don\\'t have cable or set-top box so this doesn\\'t make sense to me. If there is a way, I haven\\'t been able to find out how yet after searching a lot online.5. The base of the TV doesn\\'t feel stable. One has to take a lot of care if one wants to move the TV.6. It\\'s very inconvenient that the ports in the center especially because of point #5 if your TV is on the table. This makes it hard to access the ports. We have to move the TV to access the ports and #5 makes it difficult. The ports should have been placed on the side. Since USB is the port I\\'ll be using the most, I got around the problem by purchasing a USB cable that I can access without moving the TV.I went for the 43in TV instead of the 55in one just because I don\\'t have place to keep the larger 55in TV. If you have place for the 55in TV and if it fits into your budget, I would recommend going for that one. It would have been nice if OnePlus offered a 43in TV with all the 55in features for a slightly higher price than the current 43in TV.,Good TV. Superb picture quality. Craaaaazy User interface.😍😍♥️,Within a month of purchase tv started hanging, need to press remote 30-40 times to get it started. loggged a complaint on 18 april and upto today issue is not resolved and one plus customer care is saying we can not tell you when it will get repaired. first and last oneplus product. worst experience.,Review update on 2/10/2020,I have contacted customer care several times, and still they haven\\'t responded. Amazon customer care just says that they follow up the matter, but still I havnt received any updates regarding they matter, they just don\\'t value people\\'s money these people just wanna sell the product n don\\'t wanna know elwhat happens after saleI have one plus mobile, so I thought that TV will be having the same quality, The tv is awesome but the service from OnePlus/Amazon is worst. Display n all is good but tv don\\'t have any built in quality.. the main board of the Tv was damaged within one month of use and till now these Amazon/OnePlus people havnt done anything to get it replaced. It\\'s your money so please don\\'t invest in these items were they don\\'t even bother to give a service,Worst experience I am facing.. Dont go for appliances in amazon.. Installation process will not done by actual slot.. They will change as per their convenient.. My TV delivered on may 19 and installation slot booked on may 20 but no one contacted me for installation while call back to customer care they simply saying wait for weeks and weeks... If we wait for installation for weeks what is the use of buying these products.. Go for flipkart they are doing same day installation too.. Lose full hope on Amazon.. No one responding properly.. Please dont buy any appliances in Amazon.. If u buy u will face same problem which I am facing..,I had worst ever than worst experience with oneplus tv.1. Very low quality build material cheaper.2. Hanging, restarting problem when you switching between app.3. Google Assistant not working since I update the Android version.4.  Sound quality is the biggest setback, it sounds like a 3rd rate speaker and sound isn\\'t balanced. There is no clarity in the sound, you won\\'t be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen.5. Frame of TV isn\\'t durable, it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute.6. Remote is very slow. It takes time and you have to proper focus infront of tv.Bad policy of amazon.Technician from oneplus visit to solve but failed, technician from amazon come two time for inspection failed to solve. they are not able to do anythingSo, I will not suggest to purchase oneplus TV a lot of problems.,Writing this review after using the tv over than a month.The picture quality is doubtlessly good.Sound is average, not good for a big room.There are problems with remote control, for eg. sometimes when the volume button is pressed on tv remote, the set top box is responding with recall command.Chromecast does slow response.Sometimes the tv automatically goes to home page.A software updating is inevitable for addressing this problems.,DESIGN bug!!Currently version 9 had been installed in my device. Everytime restart (/Power on reset) takes the time to 27Jan2021 & 1:00PM. Because of this Google products aren\\'t working unless I change the time settings manually to current date and time.So I strongly recommend to take opinion from other users too.Am planning to raise service request on this issue to Amazon.,The display is Hdready n worst color saturation n brightness is killing after watching for 30 min for 7 days I ruined my eyes and when contacted Amazon they say follow up n complain to one plus in return one plus Rngennier resettled while tv which ruined the display more n it is so bright that u see white patches n if reduce the background light n brightness Color’s gets dark one plus not ready to listen or change the tv I think I have done blunder by purchasing only in the name of one plus … be informed pl don’t blindly buy see it to believ it,I have contacted Amazon multiple times and every time I get the same answer, there is no stock for replacement. I am clueless about what should be my next step.Extremely BAD after-sales services. worst.Better to get a TV from local store than such products.,Back in July 2020, OnePlus launched its budget TVs line up. I prebooked the TV on the launch day itself. After around two weeks, the TV went on flash sale for the first time. I received the TV after a week. I got the TV for around Rs.20,000. I prebooked the device for Rs 1000, which gave me two years extended warranty and Rs 1000 amazon cashback. Also, I got Amazon Echo Dot for free and a TV which I returned and got a refund for the same. It was a great deal, and so I decided to go for the OnePlus TV.With an excellent price tag, it comes with some exciting features like OnePlus Connect, Dolby Audio Enhancement, Oxygen Play, Chromecast, Google Assistant built-in and compatible with Amazon Alexa. I was very much excited to unbox and try the OnePlus TV. It also comes with Android 9.0. Unboxing the TV and attaching the table mount was an easy process. Also, setting up the device was very easy.Initial Impressions:When I first started the device, it was lagging a lot. However, there was already a software update available when I just started the device. I quickly updated the device, and the TV was still not working smooth enough. I think going 1 GB RAM is not enough. The picture quality is impressive, and the sound quality isn’t good at default settings. After tweaking the sound, it sounded terrific. Regarding connectivity, it was very smooth. The bezel-less design was the most attractive part of the TV.Design:The design is the most decisive point of the TV. It comes with a bezel-less display, an 88.5% screen to body ratio, and an enhanced viewing experience. It is slim from the back of the TV. Also, the ports are accessible quite easily. The table mount is also of decent quality, and there is a LED indicator in the bottom right corner of the TV. Overall, I loved the design and form factor of the TV.Rating: 4.5/5.Display:The display comes with a bunch of fancy features. It comes with a 1080p resolution and has DCI-P3 93% provides excellent colour reproduction. It uses Gamma Engine for picture enhancement and has features like Anti-Aliasing, Noise Reduction, Dynamic Contrast and colour space mapping. It also comes with various display tweaks such as sports mode, movie mode and many others. But I just tweaked them to get the best out of the TV. The default settings aren’t as good as expected. After tweaking, the colours and overall picture quality is soothing. Although, I think the 60fps doesn’t look smooth enough. It seems like 30-40 fps. To sum up, the display is excellent at this price point, although you need to tweak the settings to get the best out of the display.Rating: 4/5Sound:It comes with a 20W speaker output and also supports Dolby Audio Enhancement. The default sound settings aren’t sounding that great. After tweaking the audio settings, it works at its best. It is loud enough and no complaints apart from default settings.Rating: 4/5Connectivity:We get all the required connectivity options. It comes with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, Ethernet, RF Connection Input, HDMI Input, AV Input, Digital Audio Output and USB Ports. And the most legendary feature is the OnePlus Connect. We can control the TV entirely using a phone, take screenshots of the TV and save and share it. You can also control the TV actions such as volume, switch input, open apps, and turn off TV using Amazon Echo Dot. But there is an issue with the remote. TV won\\'t power on-off-on the first attempt. It also doesn’t have a dedicated input switch button.Rating: 3/5Pros:1)  Awesome colour accuracy, DCI-P3 93% and beautiful display quality.2)  Great sound quality with features like Dolby Audio Enhancement, Dialogue Enhancer, Dolby Surround etc3)  OnePlus Connect App features like taking TV Screenshots, controlling TV etc.4)  Aggressive price point.5)  Amazon Echo Dot integration and Google Assistant Built-In.6)  Bezel-Less display enhances the viewing experience.Cons:1)  It lags a lot at times and especially after turning on the TV from sleep mode.2)  TV won\\'t power on the first attempt 90% of the times.3)  Default Audio and Display Settings aren’t the best.4)  1 GB RAM isn’t enough for the TV.5)  No Wall Mount inside the box.6)  No input switch button on the remote.,Really loved the OPtv y seriesHave some lil probs bt thts finee, hope OnePlus will fix this in next update. Everything works fine so farLittle lag bt it\\'s okay it happens in every android TVOnePlus tv is handy with OnePlus mobile phones... But doesn\\'t support screen cast with Mi phonesAudio n video quality is top notch(need to change in settings). Overall best for this price range,Writing this review after a month of use.Pros :- compare to other tv in this price range sound quality is good- smooth installation after paying installation charges around 1k plus including wall mount- picture quality is goodCons :- voice recognition is annoying- Bluetooth paring is messy some time u need to unpair and pair again (in case of u r connecting a sound at ),totally disappointed with the reliability of the one+ tv experience. decided to go for this product in spite of a few nasty reviews online because of the trust in the brand. issues noticed from day 1. TV switches off on its own which was experienced 4-5times in the first week. TV gets stuck while switching on, then a restart is required by turning off the power. lag noticed occasionally while playing/browsing. i was fortunate enough to experience the issues in the earlier days itself so that I could ask for a return. keeping the issues aside, the look and feel of TV is just amazing, screen and sound clarity are impressive. really good features.,1.Worst delivery: Myself being a prime member got the product after 8 days.Followed up for 4 days complained multiple time abt product not delivered.Multiple calls uffff........2.could see finger prints on the TV screen just when opened from box.3.worst thing which i am scared is could see blur screen n lines while setting up the tv itself😭🙈4.Bluetooth remote pairing takes very long time.5.Screen is very very fragile.6.sound quality is very poor.7.Picture quality is good.,Awsome experience.👉🏼 Installation - Quick, clean and fine accuracy.👉🏼 Demo - Amazing. Executive was so calm to explain each feature in detail (sometimes multiple times to multiple family members).👉🏼 Picture quality - 5 star. All streaming apps runs on HD content. Cable Channels are SD, though we can\\'t see major difference in video quality.👉🏼 Sound - Real Dolby. We generally use only 5% volume in my 12x15 size drawing room.👉🏼 Set top box - Existing Airtel DTH SD set top box gives good video quality, so we don\\'t feel to upgrade to HD set top box.👉🏼 Streaming performance - Superb. My kid watches YouTube 80% of the time in a day. FHD Video streaming is superb in YouTube premium with my You Broadband 50 Mbps Wifi network.👉🏼 Bluetooth - Sometimes my kid uses Bluetooth Handsfree while watching TV, especially in afternoon when everyone in home are sleeping except him. Sound quality even in bluetooth is awsome, without any relay.👉🏼 I had bought Mi & One plus both 32\" TV on same day for 2 homes from Amazon. I MUST say - One plus brand & Amazon commerce platform is best to choose.,Purchased it on 5th July. Seems to be good, so far.,This tv got screwed up within one years time.. when I lodged a complaint within warranty period.. no one came to repair.. every week they keep saying next week .. next week...  The week never comes... It has been two months ..Never buy anything from ONE PLUS EVER. Neither is Amazon helping us out...,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Considering price, it\\'s a great value for money. Picture quality and sound is just perfect. Best thing is sophisticated remote with only required key options. It\\'s been 4 days we\\'ve used this TV and haven\\'t faced and lag ussues or any other issues. So far quite happy with the product.,OnePlus TV Panel had developed horizontal lines since last 4 months and I had been chasing the company for service through various modes including chats but nothing worked out. Today booked service through Amazon to see how they respond now but yes service is extremely pathetic. 4 months have passed and I\\'m losing this warranty benefit. No one from OnePlus responds on the same. I did a big mistake of my decision to purchase OnePlus TV,Writing the review after 1.5 years of usage.Good:1.  The display looks good for this price range2. Really good if you are using this as a secondary display for your laptop3. Sound quality is promising4. Picture color quality is comparatively goodBad:1. Lags when you use any of the inbuilt apps. Specially Prime, Disney+Hotstar, YouTube, etc.,2. Sometime it automatically switch from HDMI mode to home screen3. Freeze during the normal operation4. Turning on with the remote is a biggest challenge and frustrating. Never found the easy way to do it, so started using the manual power button5. Switch off the TV if not in use, or else it will turn on automatically and spoil your sleep,I have bought One plus Tv as I was very much happy with one plus brand after using the one plus 7 phone.I was badly disappointed with the product. Thanks to amazon as they took the unit return back and refunded the money.I want to tell separately about the bad experiences:1. Picture quality: It was sometime too bright and sometimes too dull. Screen was blue & green sometimes as you see in the attached image.2. HDMI Port was faulty.Sound Quality: quality of the sound was like cheap speakers used in the TV unit.Overall Comment: Not up to the expectations. Not recommended to purchase.,After 15 days of usage I see the product works too slow.The picture quality is fine. After switching on the TV we can expect the response only after 1-2 minutes. That in my opinion a waste to buy. Normal smart or android tv work faster than OnePlus.Sound is satisfactory.Google voice search doesn\\'t work.Couldn\\'t add OnePlus account to the TV.OnePlus connect ( using OnePlus mobile as remote) looks like a joke or silly app to use because that doesn\\'t work and connect well with OnePlus mobile.Do not waste time waiting for the sale.,I am writing this review after using this tv for 5 months and I received two updates in 5 months. Tv picture quality is amazing you get the best viewing experience but sound and it\\'s android is pathetic. From starting I see lags in this TV and I thought it get resolved after updates but it\\'s not resolved yet. Syetem interface is really slow. If you\\'re planning to buy this tv go for upper one plus TV not this one.,Picture quality.. AmazingRemote control.. Very soft speedy oprationSound quality.. Quite dispointed but not bad for 43 inches tv.Overall oneplus is best as other comparative.I am used oneplus mobile from last 6 years.Only amezon service was very bad not customer supportive.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0This is after 1 week of usage watch attached video, After speaking to Amazon Customer care they have assigned some Amazon service agent. The agent said he will fix the issue but even after 2 months there is no resolution to my issue. Never expected such a worst service from Amazon purchase. Even after reaching to 1+ CC, they said they will sendsome technician, but till now after 20 days no one reached. I request who ever see this review never ever purchase from Amazon site & 1+ products.I\\'ll give -5 rating,TV screen is defective after using 6 months. And Amazon is not providing warrenty claim for the TV. Upon raising service request, Amazon mark it completed without any technician. I suggest not to buy this product from Amazon because you will not get any warrenty claim if product is defective. One year warranty claim is fake, Amazon is not providing any warrenty claim. Don\\'t buy from Amazon.,Tv is absolutely value proposition. All required features are in the tv. If you have a one plus phone then its a quick sync for first time installation.Dislike- does not come with a wall mount stand & the hd cable requirement is a 2.0 cable... These offset you by an additional amount depending on what you add on..Also you need to proactively call the installation guys as they were not aware of my installation job...,Guys please don\\'t buy oneplus TV and it\\'s not a good product. We bought a new TV(3 Months old) and now it\\'s not working now. I have called the support and written back and forth emails but no support. It\\'s a worst support which I have never seen till today. Go for the MI or Samsung.,User interface is good. Sound quality is poor. Have to use external speakers for clear sound. Better options are available in this price range.Edit: After using the TV for 4 months. I have downgraded my rating form two to one star. Bluetooth connectivity is very poor. You get delayed response. The screen has started bleeding. Already have a bright line on the screen which is spreading with each passing day. Worst TV in this budget. Don\\'t buy it. Go for other options.,NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.I bought this product in October and the installation date given was 1 month later. Yet the technician had no mood to install it. Further, the Television worked fine for 3 months and one fine day its screen display went dark. We thought it was a Tata sky set talk box issue but later the other hdmi slot also went dark... I have been calling amazon every single day to provide a warranty repair... but for the past fifteen days they are not able to arrange a technician to visit us. I\\'m fed up calling and explaining the issue again and again. I\\'m now looking for a refund r else i will be forced to go to the consumer forum.,Total Waste of money. Got the tv in flash sale and in only 1 month remote control stopped working. Asked for technical support, the Amazon guy came for inspection and found the remote control faulty and told that it will get replaced but did not get any replacement till date.  Neither Amazon is responding properly neither one plus is responding. Will suggest buying some other product from a local vendor to get support on an immediate basis.,Picture quality is good. Look & Feel is good.Sound is 2/5..TV build quality is goodOnly 4GB memory is available out of 8GB.Oxygen Play is useless.Apps take ~10 sec to openSo much lag in TVTake 30+ sec to startApp close automatically because of lack of memoryDidn\\'t expect from OnePlus for such a pover product.Go for Realme TV,Pricing wise it is goodPicture quality is goodBut they using normal grade panelLight weightSound level is low when compared to other smart TV segments in this price range like other brands mi,realme&VUBluetooth,wifi, is the best featuresWall mount should buy separatelyEven official oneplus wall mount is not available in online technician provides other brandThat is higher price than the oneplus399₹ approx if the right availability in oneplus brand that priced at ₹199 only but bad luck it\\'s not availableOverally speaker volume must be important to improve in upcoming oneplus TV\\'sUsing a good grade panel gives lot more quality I think,My schedule of my installation ws on 9 may bt nobody came & also nobody call me today on 12 wn I call Amazon they the person who ws on call otherside shows that they dnt hv any respect to customers & he says person fr installation will came on 17 total 8 days delayed bt they dnt fell sorry fr this & they say that if I open box warranty will go I will nt gt warrantyThis ws gift fr smone it birthday ws on 11 may & I will hv to wait till 17may to see if tr is tv inside or something alse,1) Installation team did not show up on scheduled day2) had to keep calling to get the installation done3) Mount was not provided for4) If charged, mount for 43\" Costs 299/- But the installation boy charged us 500 for it5) installation agent was very rude , arrogant and unprofessional6) Wasnt ready to give us a reciept for the extra amount when asked,Service was the worstest from oneplus... The tv got problem with the motherboard and for the repair service i was still waiting from August 26th 2021 (more than 2 months) still waiting nothing happened... Everything was ok with the tv... But never expect any service from oneplus customer support or oneplus... when you call oneplus customer support you have to wait on the line for the whole day to get irresponsible answers from oneplus... Amazon will help you but i request please dont go for oneplus products... worst customer support i have ever seen...,Product is ok but one plus service is horrible.Yes I mean it..its horrible..!!!I need some technical assistance as I\\'m unable to connect my router with smart tv & I requested couple of times to pay a visit and give demo. Unfortunately no one turned up till date & giving lame excuses.I\\'m surprised if I have been treated like this within product warranty what I\\'ll do after warranty exhausted.One plus Customer care is pathetic a major cause of concern please don\\'t ignore this.Tv has couple of technical issue while mapping with other external device like lan, Bluetooth & all.,Pros: Excellent picture quality. Voice quality is good but needs go to settings and do setup to genre you watching. I set it to sports for everything. I bought it in annual sale and it is nice prodct under this price.Cons: No bootup sound or beep when powered on or used remote so you have to press remote quite hard. Takes good 1-1.5minuts to boot up.Overall verdict - Satisfied with the picture quality and sound quality of product. Could use a notification sound to save my remote though.Amazon installation service is not great as they force you to purchase wall mount stand and charge the installation.  Also the TV was delivered on time but it sat there over the weekend as the installation person could only come after 2days. Moreover they void your warranty if you go for DIY installation or setup which is pretty easy to do. Strange from amazon.,Picture and sound quality are good but occasional glitches with respect to frozen or slow response while content surfing. This needs tv to be restarted to make it smooth again. My mitv which is slightly cheaper works flawlessly in this aspect and OnePlus has a lot to improve via software update maybe,I wish I had read the review’s on oneplus official facebook page. 99% people are complaining about the service providing by one plus.Now let me share what happens with me:I bought this TV through amazon with amazon and one plus brand warranty. Now I am facing some issues with my TV. I called the amazon service to fix my tv and I called them many many times and no one visit at my home to fix the tv ( to let you know I am living in Delhi-NCR not himalayas) so when amazon is failed to do that they escalated my request to oneplus and now it’s more than a month I am still calling them to fix my tv and every time they said we escalated your request to related department kindly wait for 3 days to visit the technician, and after 3 days you called they again saying the same thing again and again. it’s really frustrating.So I SUGGEST DON’T GO WITH ONE PLUS TV,I was bit worried about the lag reported by some reviewers. Fortunately I did not face any problems. The picture quality is very good, sound is also good, menu options work well except voice commands which I couldn\\'t get running.Couldn\\'t have asked for more at this price point.Highly recommended.Update: Got the voice recognition running. Great performance 👌👌👌,I am really afraid about purchasing the tv because of the negative reviews I have seenBut after I have bought the product I am so satisfied with it and I must not have bothered negative reviewsThe picture quality is good mines an SD CONNECTION It would be awesome with a HD connectionMany said the sound is bad but I don’t see it like that because at 20% of the sound everyone at my home in any room of the houseYou need the adjust the sound at sound settings for better sound with the Dolby given the sound is fascinatingIt is good budget tvBought it along with AlexaMine is a remote location but got the installation done right the next day after the item has been received,Bad sound quality. Bad picture quality. Really regret my decision choosing this TV. Go for some real brands. This is Chinese scrap. Taking forever to load apps like YouTube prime video. Everytime it starts fresh, taking few mins to load even you turn off in remote,The installation executive charged me Rs. 300/- cash for wall mounting brackets since they are not included in the price of the TV. This information should have been clearly mentioned on the product description but it was not!Also, initially I was very disappointed with the sound output of the TV. The installation executive said that this is the best possible. But later when I adjusted the sound settings from the menu the sound output increased dramatically.,LED TV / Y series 32Y1 / TV worked 1ly for 7 days / contacting customer care for more than 1 and half month / no one came to repairI bought this one plus LED TV this 20th October 2021 through amazon. The worked properly only for 7 days. then display stopped working only audio is coming. Since then I am contacting customer care regularly everytime they say within next 36 to 48 hours technician will contact me. But no one contacted me. I asked phone number of technician but they say they don\\'t have. For past one and half month I am contacting customer care for more than 8 times still same reply but nothing was done. my location is urban area only. selling very poor quality TV is one thing. They can\\'t even provide repair services in urban area.Very very worst product don\\'t even think of buying it.,it\\'s a old model tv you cannot get dual band frequency o. the tv and if you need to do any this with picture quality the you will need to stop the movie and then go to service to resolve the issues other brand tv have better features than this old technology,The TV\\'s composite input went bad in less than a month of usage. Registered a complaint on the oneplus support site. No response since then, no calls, emails or texts from OnePlus support. The visit date has come and gone and I have tried various methods to contact OnePlus support (email, call, chat) without success.The TV quality is below average: there is a grey ghosting when the screen is perfectly black even on the android bootup screen, sound is extremely poor (I can never get rid of a boom in the TV speakers) and the TV does not respond to the remote half the time.My advice: Go for a well known brand with better service network. It may cost more, but you will be happier in the long run. If you are on a budget, look for other cheaper brands. OnePlus just does not have the quality assurance or the service network in place for their TVs.Update: after I posted the above review I called OnePlus support. I had on hold waiting for a rep for a very long time (close to 15 minutes I think), but finally got through. The service person guided me through doing a reset of the TV and to my surprise it fixed the composite input issue. I also think the sound has improved a bit. So the software appears to be a little buggy, but the TV is in usable state now.,Very bad service provide by Amazon ,Tv is fill with lot of issue like-Choromecast, startupAmazon is not returning this product once deliver if your product also have faults.Poor service by Amazon,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I\\'m using this OnePlus TV since more than a month now and so far all is good and fantastic. Picture quality is really good. People are complaining for sound quality and power but I\\'ve found it adequate.. I will say yes for this product if you\\'re looking for something similar..,Poor sound and lags too much,Nice Android TV with a nice display. Great for streaming Youtube, Disney+ Hotstar, Netflix and Amazon Prime. CEC features work quite well. HDMI content also displays great. Sound quality is very good, does not break even on louder settings. Overall quite good product.,Got the TV in May 2021, by July it started giving issues and by September it completely stopped working,  after sale is horrible,  we were told panel is spoilt need to change,  it\\'s the end of NOVEMBER,  ONE PLUS HASN\\'T EVEN BOTHERED TO DO ANYTHING,  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON ALSO AS I COMPLAINED MULTIPLE TIMES WITH SCREENSHOTS BUT AT NO AVAIL,To start with the weight is definitely light hence easy to install on a wall. Good decent picture quality for the money one spends on it. Can\\'t expect clarity like expensive one on this. Now the down sides of this android TV.1. The sound quality is bad, dialogues can\\'t be heard sometimes and you really have to crank up the volume to an irritable level.2. Remote is definitely not the most responsive of the lot. Each button needs to be pressed couple of times while pointing at the right direction for it to work.3. Speak function is worst. Absolutely non usableBuy only if you use your television seldomly.,Plz Help Regarding my Tv One Plus Y series , I need Replacement Becoz Tv have Issue in HDMI port Pictures are flipping and One Plus Doesn’t Have Parts Waiting From Last 1 weeks while I ordered recently this One new TvIt get resolved and Fully Appreciated,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Guys , this was by far the best purchase I have made , my wife is a 1 plus fanatic, so I purchased this thinking \\'it won\\'t be that good\\' . To my surprise the out put till now has been amazing , there is slowness here and there while updating but that\\'s normal. For this price this TV does not disappoint.  Premium look and premium quality,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Don\\'t buy this TV. Worst experience. Bought it only 4 months back when it was launched. But now the screen display is flickering and stuttering. The OnePlus service team is so poor that they could not even respond properly. Oneplus may be a good brand for high end mobiles but not for any other consumer goods. I just want some technician to arrive at my place to sort the issue out. No one is responding properly. Service team sets a bad example for OnePlus. Oneplus service team is not like for samsung or any other big brands. Their network is so small that they can\\'t provide the service on time and in many areas.,TV is good. Light weight and easy to use.It is so light that I have to go to the warehouse to pick that up because the delivery person says he can\\'t come to deliver. And he was okay if I complain. I got the TV after almost 10 days when it had reached the warehouse. And the best part the delivery team were not even concerned about it. I just walked in after so much frustration and picked the tv and then I got a msg on my phone saying Your order is out for delivery. I hope Amazon does take some action.,TV is ok for use. Don\\'t expect too much from oneplus . I expected a lot more from TV like oneplus phones.Pros-◆Good picture quality not better◆software is user friendly◆connectivy is fast◆responsive remote  ( 1st time faced lag. After updated it solved)Cons-◆Low sound◆response of voice command is a lit more lag◆viewing experience is not as good. 90° view get better quality .But in 120° showing a shadow◆tv mirroring is difficult,This TV has really, really by the picture quality. The grey uniformity of the screen is really very bad (even worse than a lot of much cheaper TVs). The viewing angles are also the worst I have ever seen in a TV... The sound is very, very bad and I wouldn\\'t recommend this TV to anyone. Despite the Android TV advantage, this TV is much worse compared to TV which cost half of this.,I ordered new tv considering my old tv would be exchanged  but delivery guys rejected it on ground that there are some marks on screen.My question why would I exchange new TV from amazon when  the reason for which i ordered was not satisfied.Advise - stop cheating people on name of exchange as your guys will come and request pls pay the difference amount and take the products etc. no point in going for exchange.I could have gone without  ordering a new tv with my older LG which is working fine till now.Exchange is tactic to fool customers, in past also same has happened with mobile also, at that time I rejected the order but this time i was trapped due to presence of family and kids .,Wall mount was not provided by technician during installation (since they did not have stock) and now I\\'m asked to pay for wall mount brackets. Isn\\'t this something that will be provided by technician during installation. For trying to adjust for technician request for handing the wall mounting bracket later, I\\'ve to pay extra price. This isn\\'t something expected from Amazon.,I buy one plus tv with high expectations but not good (picture and sound quality good) one plus led tv hdmi not working last 2month no service centre no response for one plus tv .any service person come he tell just u r hdmi port not working wecannot handle and we cannot repair last 2month I cannot seeing my entertainment.my suggestion pls think and buy money not come easy,PLEASE BHIAYON DHYAN DE,MERE SATH DHOKHA HUYA HAI.

ISKE LIYE GHAR MAIN DO PHONE HONA JARURI HAI, OR PHONE MAIN INTERNET BHI HONA CHAHIYE NAHI TO CONNECT NAHI HOGA.MIRACASTING NOT CONNECTING EASYLY, SCREEN MONITORING CONNECTION VERY POORPRODUCT FETURE NOT ACCEPTABLE THIS ITEM.,I have been an One Plus fan since I got the One Plus 6T. Upon a lot of convincing my Dad finally trusted a One Plus TV as he is traditionally a fan of Samsung, Panasonic and other \"established\" TV\\'s. The One Plus TV not only has impressed him but the prompt installation and customer support has helped increase his faith in an otherwise \"new\" company. Coming to the TV the picture quality is amazing and the voice recognition along with Alexa works like a charm. Despite many negative reviews on the sound quality I found it satisfactory and absolutely upto the mark. I DONT NEED ANY EXTERNAL SPEAKERS as the sound quality is DAMN GOOD. Coupled with a good high speed Wifi this TV is a STEAL at this price. Other smart LED TV\\'s are 10k expensive and with no other Notable increase in any features (as I have seen in many of my friends homes).,OnePlus has done a commendable job with this product. Great picture quality with Good sound. Best in its segment. Don\\'t go for YouTube reviews, I think that\\'s the drama made by the youtubers on reviewing this product. This product has nice built quality as well.Only thing is you need to update its firmware when you connect to internet for the first time. Because picture quality is not as good as after update. 👍👍👍,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0It is completely budget tv..Picture quality goodAudio quality poorRemote and voice recognize averageThere is no audio output for old home theatresBuild quality not that greatNo wallmount we need to pay extra 600rs while installing (worst wall mount)It is not slim tvPathetic installation service,First of all i was in dilema that tv will in good condition or not but than i purchased it and its out of the expectation deleivery was fast , installation was on time and cool features and also its pocket friendly product  overall experience its an awesome 5star thums up,I purchased tv but in a month when I connected amazon fire stick i realized the ARC-HDMI port was not functioning. I filed complaint to ONEPLUS first and Amazon then. The Technician never visited my home after his only first visit in NOV 2020. Always made false reporting, always rescheduling and cancelling visit appointments and even after then just updating \"waiting for parts\" I thank Amazon who accepted return of my television in January 2021 and till 9th March 2021 he was making false reporting; ultimately i told him about my return of television and he ended the service ...... I HAVE TO SURRENDER A GOOD TELEVISION (just a small defect) BECAUSE OF THE PATHETIC SERVICE.  Later I purchased Hisense 43A71F from FLIPKART with 3 years complete protection plan of flipkart ( my OnePlus tv also had a extended warranty/ protection policy) . I changed TV brand and purchase app just because of this service..... I hope this feedback will take some measures which will benefit your future customers!,OnePlus is a brand what i know , it gives premium quality product ,but in this y series tv of 32 inches  ,its not upto the mark  , i will rate by its performance 3/5 , product it good but performance is not upto the mark if i compare to MI 4 tv as in same segment , infact its performance is comparatively more better than oneplus tv , .Issues what i am facing1. When you will power on the tv. First it shows blue screen for 3-5 seconds ,i don\\'t kniw why .2. Performance is low it tooks overall 20 second to start completely.3. While give indication to power on by your remote you will not to know ,is it actually on or off because it takes around 3-5 second to show response .4. If you are restless person then this tv is not for you ,i recomend personal .5.but all these software kind of issue ,it may be resolved over updated maybe ,but for now i dont want to go with this oneplus y series tv . I am not 100 percent satisfied.Or next its your call whether you want to go with this product or not . OnePlus is a good brand but this y series may bring it down.,Good,Panel damaged within 10 months of purchase. Less than 1 hour of daily use on average. The company doesn’t have spare parts available. Have been asked to wait 1-3 months for panel replacement. Better off buying VU tv. Much better picture quality, reliability and service availability.,Tv got delivered in good condition and installation went wellcoming to the tv picture quality it\\'s awesome . Got all ott applications . had a problem with oneplus connect app connecting to TVI have seen many complaining about sound but in my opinion its crazy. i want to tell u guys 1 thing if you want theatre experience go to theatre its a TV not a sound system so stop complaining about sound.At last go for it dont change your mind on other companies and waste timeAs these r my early days ill update abt the TV again after a monthupdatesound and picture quality are crazyoneplus connect app is laggyhaving issues with screen mirroring(hoping for the update) directly , But i have no issue with screen mirroring from youtube, prime...... applicationssupports 3rd party applications alsoas the ram is low it takes time to load apps once cache is formed apps open at good speedRi8 now best tv in budget segment,Installation team took 8 days after delivery.It is bluetooth remote, but sometimes it won\\'t work. We have to use it as IR remote.TV is very slow to operate and apps crashes frequently.Connecting mobile remote is a hectic process.Even if you change color mode in tv, it will work with default color settings while watching tv through AV port.Poor panel quality.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I am writing this review after 6 months of usePurchased on jan 2021Pros:Good picture quality: Color gamet is really working. You can see vibrant color on Screen. Fully satisfiedAudio: audio is ok for one single room and ya ofcourse Dolby sound is also working niceDesign: bazzle less design will attracts attention while tv is ON or OFF, it looks very good like a modern smart TVCons:1. Vertical line on screen:After 6 months of use i got single vertical line on screen which is very disappointing for a brand One Plus, Tv was ideal on Wall and one day i saw a vertical line next day i got 3 lines and now as you can see in the picture there are 6 bold lines on the screen.I have called to customer care and no response after 1 week.2. Remote voice command is not working from very first day of installation but that was ok in front of screen fault.3. You have to pay 300 Rs as a installation charge for 32inch TV,Writing this review after using it for a month.I am using this as just smart tv not with any cable connection or DTH service.1.Sharpness gets set to 0 automatically out of no where and u will watch your tv playing everything in black & white and once this happens TV never works the same as before.2. Picture quality is not so great.3. TV gets hang in all the applications.4. It\\'ll go back to initial screen while you are watching something.5. Sometimes it works as radio you play some video but u can only hear it and entire screen will become blank 😑6. Amazon warranty claim service is pathetic, I\\'ve raised a request and waited for 5 days still no technician had visited from OnePlus to provide service and amazon doesn\\'t have any information regarding that, simply they offer this service,As per the scheduled installation date Technician not reported & after 4/5 days also it\\'s not done.Finally we have arranged Technician from Local area & Fixed it.1.Fast delivery2.Sound&Picture quality good3.Price Ok4.Service : No Service team in odissa? After receive the material we wait for install it 1week but nobody reached for installation.Finaly arranged Technician from out side & Fixed itWe never expect that the poor service from Amazon Team,PLEASE DON\\'T BUY THIS SCRAP PRODUCT ...  I CAME TO KNOW ... I WASTED 24,500 AFTER 5 DAYS OF USAGE.  IF YOU BUY THIS DEFINALTY YOU WILL LOOSE PIECE OF MIND.SAD STORY STARTS NOW ...I am writing review after 5 days of usage.  Product got delivered on 18th Feb 2020 and Installation is done on 27th Feb 2020 (9 days after delivery).  I can\\'t able to use TV without wall mounting because of limitations at my home.  Basic functionality \"Display\" is lost after 5 days of usage. I could not able to return because of return policy of 12 days of delivery. (return button is disabled).  Initially I thought it was setup box problem that after troubleshooting I came to conclusion that it was TV display problem.SAD STORY CONTINUES ..... I raised a complaint to amazon( 6th march) they told that they will send a technician to check problem and scheduled appointment is on 31 March 2020.  Now I have wait for 25 days to technician to come and inspect.Brand value of ONEPLUS in mobile category is GOOD , When it comes to TV , ONEPLUS made a scarp product. If basic functionality display is not working as expected  --- ITS BRAND VALUE IS ZERO.Coming to AMAZON ...  I didn\\'t buy a product on road side PLATFORM.  Didn\\'t expect worst service from AMAZON for SCRAP product (Inspection after 25 days after complaint)SAD STORY CONTINUES .....  Don\\'t know if AMAZON will help me or not,I had ordered this tv as a gift for my sister. After 15 days their is a black line appear on the screen and after some hour whole screen became black and nothing can be seen on the screen. Now we can only hear the sound with this tv. Because it happens after 15 days so Amazon refused to give us replacement and suggest us to contact with OnePlus. Now OnePlus taking its own time to decide whether they will give me a new replacement or they will repair this crap. Don\\'t know how much time they will take?,We faced a lot of issue with the TV. Everything related to tv is good but the smart part really is disappointing. We have to wait 1-2 minutes before the TV turns on. Google assistant is not responsive most of the time. Not a smooth experience. And just for reference my internet speed is 200 mbps.Will recommend you all buy a normal TV and use amazon firestick instead. Firestick is smarter than the smart TV by one plus.,I love OnePlus products and I hve a device bullets as wel TV, all there products r too good n I will surely recommend all my frndz and family members to purchse TV, dolbby version in TV has got a amazing audio effects, I am proud to tell all my frndz dat am an OnePlus user and own it, never expected dat I would really feel so comfortable using TV also there z a very good quick response form customer service also itz easy to book a repair frm OnePlus care app, as world z becoming smarter even booking a repair z so simple by using user friendly app and the technician repairs it in front of our eyes which is really amazing and happy to tell woooow and a big salute to OnePlus brand.Cheers!Manjunath Rey,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Purchase this during Amazon sale for my room and it’s an excellent TV. Have been using it for more than a month now and there have been not any issues such.Pros:1. Amazing clarity2. Amazing sound for a small room3. Chrome cast or casting works neatly4. All the apps work extremely fine.5. The Bluetooth remote is extremely good and there is a knack to use this - it gets switched off due to inactivity so if you want to quickly turn on your TV you’ll have to press on the power on button twice with a gap of 3 to 4 seconds in between.Cons:1. There is a lag while starting the TV and some apps.2. Voice recognition take some time.Lags do happen because you’re paying not a big price for a TV like this which is feature loaded so I feel this is worth the Buy!,Picture quality is bad may be some defect,Never experienced like this from OnePlus Product earlier as i am fan and mad about the brand.but this product proved that oneplus is also doing the same gimmicks like others, slowly loosing their never settle tag.1. worst packaging damaged box, completely wet on wet2. TV has a lag will not response to the remote and even crashes and freezes sometime3. light bleed from the frame4. dark patches on the screen5. if your ceiling fan is running, forget about the TV output sound, worst output hard to hear.6. worst Amazon customer service no technical knowledge and always demand for pictures and disconnect the call.Amazon declined to replace and offered refund of 21150/- as against 23k which I paid for the TV after waiting for 45days and even brought pre book deal from Acko and cashback and alexa, customer service simply says product is not available for replacement cancel and take refund of 21150. never thought of writing a negative feedback on Oneplus, brand is loosing its value, I will strongly say Worst product from Oneplus and worst service from Amazon.,Amazon delivery very fast. Received next day but installation is cumbersome. The technician neither called me or came for installation on the scheduled day. When I called him, he will send someone for installation. I am watching the TV on table stand. Only drawback of the product is lag in every step. Picture quality is marvelous but sound quality is not clear and upto the mark. Considering the cost, the product is perfect.,After reviewed 1month I\\'m sharing this details , first impression is Voice recognise is working very quickly , and software updates got 1 time when time of unboxing Only, very light weight and good sound speakers , Wi-Fi receives good Singals strength , and very fastly moving through remote operates , android OS is not bad , Using OnePlus android app manage easily TV , Completely Awesome this Product .Cons:Using bluetooth headphone 🎧 connected to TV , sound is not good and something noise happening,I\\'m a big fan of OnePlus products and I was so happy when they announced the 32\" TV Y series. I pre ordered it on the first day itself. But later I\\'ve realised that it was the biggest mistake. The OnePlus trademark of quality doesn\\'t applicable on the this Y-Series. It feels like they have just put OnePlus logo on some cheap quality TV. I\\'m getting regular issues with the TV. If I claim for service the person comes and resets the TV and says everything it good and after 3-4 days same issue happens. 1st Issue: The screen went blank and only audio came without video. 2nd Issue: Video stuck and audio continues and remote doesn\\'t work. 3rd Issue: Sometimes Remote doesn\\'t work. 4th: There is some little gap in between the outside panel and the screen and when I showed it to the service person he says it is normal due to sensors present that gap is visible.but there is no sensor present in the middle. 5th: User interface sucks. 6th: Bluetooth connectivity issue. Multiple times I reported and the service person comes and resets the TV and leave.  7th: Connectivity b/w TV and remote is the worst. All the time the TV sucks. Do not go for it. If you want a 32\" TV in the budget go for MI or RealMe. OnePlus Y series is worst in the entire OnePlus lineup.,Picture quality is not good black is like brown and sound quality is very very poor I suggest you do not buy ☹️😞☹️😞,After installation and using one month I noticed that.there is a problem with the Android TV it\\'s automatically turned off. Some time its hang no function is working. I have to restart again. If you\\'re having a good budget then go ahead with the other brands this is my personal opinion but I find this TV is not reliable .,Sir , i have buyed it last few days in starting four to five days its working perfectly and now its gonna blur video quality and not happy with this product if company has send their executive to check it so its good otherwise it not a good and there is no customer support from this product also...sir i m trying to cl again and again but there is not a good response from their side.please pay attention regarding this and resolve this problem as the earliest.,Screen problem (disappears automatically)Sound problem ( not cleared)WiFi connection ( connection gone automatically nd shows no connectivity )Picture quality ( suddenly shows  Black nd white pictures)I suggest don\\'t buy it if u think it\\'s one+ tv 😞 disappointed so much,I brought this tv at the republic day sale and I regret taking this tv.Let me start with the good points about the tv- The sleek and Bazel less design.- User Interface is pretty good.Pain Points:- The installation experience has been pathetic and I in fact got it after a week of follow-up and complaint raising.- The tv is terribly slow - The booting of the TV takes a lot of time and Screen to Screen lag time is very high.- In the first week itself, The google assistant stopped working and I raised further complaints, the service guys then said that they will replace the remote but till now - No further response.- The colour and contrast combinations are pretty bad.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Full waste of money. Requesting everyone please do not buy one plus company TV . After buy my tv within one month screen automatically damaged and it will repair by one plus next two months and there customer care executives are always give u a fake promise. Attachment video for your reference,Was shocked to receive product with no plastic covers. it was all covered in dust inside. TV Stands plastics were removed, there were no screws present. Scratches on TV back panel. Remote was also looking used.I got the feeling that may be they sent me Display unit. But amazon was so prompt after I sent them pictures and coordinated on call with them, they immediately arranged for reverse pick up and I refund got initiated in 48 hours.,Perfect choice, a small lag for remote, in simple words its a perfect choice and value for money. Easy to install, more simple than using a mobile phone, voice assist is not tested since android phone is required for that.Please go ahead with your choice!,The TV is excellent, no issues with the same. However, the installation of the TV leaves a lot to be desired. The technician deputed to do the installation are ill equipped to do the same. They do not have proper tools or bits for the installation and are in a hurry to leave. They have little/no knowledge of the features in the TV and seem ignorant. There standrard reply is see the video on youtube. Dissapointed with the installation, had to get the same installed privately by making payments. Other than that the TV is good, worth the price.,I am very disappointed with the service Amazon provided, I purchase OnePlus Y series TV. Within 3 months TV screen gone. When I request for warranty on 22 June 2021 and asking for solution they just escalate the issue. No resolution till date.The product must replaced with the new product if you not able to fullfill the service.,Good,I regret buying this oneplus Tv. I just bought your 32 inch TV last week or so thro Amazonlast couple of days I find that the tv uis having some problemWhen I am watching channels, suddenly it goes off to the home screen, it is not coming coming backNow I regret buying your tv.Their after sales is very poor, to attend a call they ask me to wait for 20 mins.  My God,The tv was ok for 4 months and then the remote stopped working , got it replaced ,and now the tv doesbt turn on or off from remote.The tv hangs often and needs to be rebootedAs much as I love my 1+ phone I hate the tv . This was a waste of money,Third class TV. Never recommend to buy this one to anybody.Atleast 3-4 times have to press start button to start the TV. Very irritating 😞. Not sure how log this TV will last. Bad choice product. I thought like one plus mobile, TV quality will also be fine.,TV is basic, speakers are average and need to get external soundbar. Installation delayed and not happened yet. Also it doesn\\'t support 5G internet so not sure if it can stream high quality videos.,I have purchased 2 OnePlus tv..tv is good bt 1 tv is panels problem i will contact OnePlus budgets tv,Just didn\\'t like the product as it is not working properly. This is the first time that I am really disappointed by Amazon and One plus but one time is enough. From now onwards Amazon will be the last resort to buy the things as well try to buy from showrooms or Flipkart. If something won\\'t be available somewhere then only will do business with Amazon.After being a Loyal customer for 7 years never expected that Amazon will treat me like this.Thanks for screwing up things.,Bought this product last year in July, from the start it had picture quality issues and the tv was very slow and laggy. In the first 2 months spots developed on the tv which resultef in changing the entire display for a new one. And now I\\'m having problems with the startup of the television, it is just showing the logo of 1plus and then switching off. Didn\\'t expect such a product from a trusted brand like OnePlus.,The main problem with it is not its speakers but the software support being given. Its software is very laggy and buggy with bugs which are never fixed. It might receive software updates but the bugs are still there every time. If you turn the tv off with remote, it turns on again on its own. Sometimes you have to press the power button several times to turn it on. If you switch between apps extensively it gets slowed down and lags till you restart it. Takes several seconds to power on.Overall, it has bad speakers and bad software. Display is good but you have to tweak it a bit because it is so saturated. So, spend some more money and don\\'t buy this product.,Did not expect from One plus. Worst experience ever. All of sudden video went into black and white and also one black lane was observed on the screen. Technician came and concluded that both back pannel and display got spolied.I raised a complaint and fighting with customer care (almost 2 months) and exchanging the mails (lot of drama happened) finally they replaced the new tv. Hope it goes few months. Can\\'t suggest you to buy this TV. Please think twice before you are going to buy.,Writing the reviews after 3 months of usage... TV on/off with the remote doesn\\'t happen in one shot.. TV gets crashed often... For tha last 4 days TV has become black and white. I have raised a compliant for which there is no proper response... And they are not ready to provide replacement as well... Need help from Amazon 🙏,with in 2 Month Wi Fi is not working TV restarting again and again .Service request logged on 16 April21 but still no one is attending this call.one False technician was allotted for this call but when I call to Technician He told That is not working with this company from Last 2 Month.I had mailed to one Plus customer care but nothing happed till date,Absolutly stunning.Oneplus did a great job.1. Picture quality : awesome , imersive.2. Sound is literallty more than enough for a large hall. Bass,sourround sound ,loudness and quality is just great. If you turn the volm. To max. , you are going to feel as if a large \"saadi wala dj\"  is in your room .3. Google assitant. , blutooh pairing , screen cast, all installed apps works seamlessly . No laging issues at all.4. Bezels are extremely thin . If you watch tv from a distance, you cant say even tv has bezels or not.5. Build quality is just great . Tv is very light weight .6 . One word review : best value for money, literally.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0First product receive. There was a line coming in the screen so tried for replacement.installation took three days. Tried for a replacement and again wait for 1 week to deliver,.product deliver now Waiting for installation 3 days already passed.Dont buy from. Amazon. They have worse installation facility and also they will take very much time. Instead go for sony. It is best instead of mi, one plus Or lg. Remote is not. Working. Faster if you use frequently,Performance is good, even it has a good clarity. I\\'m giving it 3 stars cuz of the poor service. I have been complaining since one month after the purchase of the product. It still has an issue with Wi-fi connectivity as well as bluetooth connectivity. It started just after a month of purchase and I have complained it for 3-4 time even still there is no response at all. Now it even has an issue with ethernet cable, ie. even after connecting ethernet cable it\\'s showing as no internet. It has such a poor customer service.,Worst, Must prefer Offline. Lot of hectic procedure. Also display was faculty. Picture gets blur anytime and it\\'s stuck for 3-5 secs.,First of all one star for Amazon not for tv from buying to installation every thing is pathetic .1. First if you want to buy this item u should have prime membership first condition2. After becoming the \"prime member\" TV is delivered after seven days it\\'s a joke from Amazon and it shows that  they don\\'t take their prime members  seriously3. And I have to wait for 10 Freaking days for insatallation4. Then that insatallation guy really he is a fraud he charged me 800 rupees for wall mount and before coming for installation he asked  there is two wall mount one is local of 400 rupees and another one is from one plus of  800 rupees so I choose the 800 one which is from one plus which is doubt full.5. One plus should add wall mount barcket in the box so these fraud installation guy can\\'t receive any one  after Amazon doesn\\'t take the liability of this they said that this is  the genuine price and I  doubt it because he didn\\'t bring the wall mount bracket in retail box and making excuse that he don\\'t have enough space in his bag .6. This is  the first time I am  buying anything from Amazon and I buy disappointem not a tv  from Amazon again thanks Amazon for this shipment experience .7. Now for tv is ok picture quality is decent but sound is not that great it\\'s loud but not clear .it could have been better connectivity is good just like everyone is saying that tv lags not in my case remote work superb no lags and everything else is ok,Bad product. No value for money,I have bought the TV on 19-Oct-2020 on Amazon Great Indian festival sale. And my honest comment is 1. Slowness while using Android and Chromecast. 2. Poor audio quality 3. When Wifi is switched on then tv automatically off and change from cable or antenna to android. So again we have to use the TV remote and change it back to cable.4. Youtube crashed some time so we have to switch off and switch on it again.,Good Product, Panel Quality and Sound is good, For the price it is worth. Smart functions can be bit overwhelming for some, but overall good experience. Android TV options are good. Even though YouTube may take but time to load and search. Still Highly recommend with my 10days only use.,The panel just went kaput, one fine day. Fortunately, during warranty period!Amazon took ages to even respond. Even escalation was handled poorly. Every Amazon agent only after getting good ratings , without any useful action.Brand responded in two days to depute a service person. More than a week later, One Plus says they do not have replacement parts in stock and DO NOT EVEN KNOW when they will be available.Typical Chinese product, buy at your own risk!!! In their association, even Amazon has got spoilt.,in this product One Plus 32\" Android LED, it is having problem when you see picture from other angle instead of straight, and it is not possible your all members can sit only infront of screen straight position only, when you will sit lightly side or side angle then colour will see fade.Same problem was in previous piece and I replaced this and new piece delivered on 27 April 2021 but same problem in this.I will recommend to all never buy this product because this is a manufacturer defect, and will lodge the compliant in my warranty, may be Amazon will help for correcting this.,Brought a TV.It worked for 21 days.And then the tv dsnt wana turn on.Never expected  this kind of thing from one plus.Very poor.Also the best part is they have many complaints like that coming for this model.Its so evident that knew there is some issue with this model of product and its  still its out for sale.And now i am being waiting for a tech to visit me from 2 days.Guys this is for any one who is buying this particular product.Plese please think twice.I dnt knw anything abt other product though this model of tv has some problems not worth the humiliation  and tension.,Have been using oneplus TV for more than 3 months now. Excellent purchase! Good picture quality, good audio output, great features! Since its android, you can install apps from built in google playstore app in the TV! I use an iPhone, no issues while casting mobile to TV screen.The only thing i dislike is that it sometimes glitches while switching between apps. Hope OnePlus fixes it soon with updates. An excellent TV in this price range. Go for it!,Changing my review after 2 months,Firstly, it does not start normally as you have to wait for a whileSecondly, after it starts, it goes to home screen by its ownAlso, Poor display and sound quality.... Cheap panel and its not OnePlus brand quality.. Moreover, its remote stopped working now 😡,Writing a review after 2 months. It’s working absolutely fine. Picture quality is good and it’s a perfect buy in the price. I tried to connect on 5G but didn’t happen but 2G also works great so I didn’t bother to call the technician. Installation was quick and paid only for wall mounting which was around 200.,Never expected this from Amazon and from One Plus, After 4 months of usage screen started flickering and complaint registered on amazon and one plus during dec 1st week 2020 its been one month over still the issue is not resolved. Thank you amazon for not taking the customer complaints on time, Thank you one plus for not valuing your customers.Please dont but anything from amazon.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I have bought one plus 32 inch smart TV in June and within a month it\\'s screen is completely malfunctioning. Please see the attached images as well as the video of my tv. I was not expecting this from Amazon. I want a new replacement for my tv. It is very pathetic and annoying user experience for me. :(,Overrall it’s Ok however I have seen it’s lagging some times when using remote. There is no support provided by one plus from product feature handling/explanation  perspective. This should be included while aligning engineer for installment else person like me have to keep calling every time to customer care. Net to net, not good experience with service front,Timely delivey and spot istalation... great purchasing expericince by AMAZONI expect One plus Mobiles range Quality in TVs also. First reason for i buying it for One plus image.After using this TV some two weeks.. i satisfied.ProsGood pictureGood soundGood RemoteConsSome apps dirict to access but. .. browsing is little bit confusing.. for children online classes ..not much usable.,TV started showing issues just on 11th day & Amazon is now paying games saying its other departments who is handling this & we can not replace as its more than 10 days. I raised calls 3-4 times they say they will get back in 24 hours & no one responds...don\\'t buy 1+ or any electronics from Amazon, as u will not get u r warranty sorted.Cons:1. TV display quality is bad2. sound is BAD3. TV do not wake up from Standby with 1 key press.4. AMAZON service SUCKS... no response,Date 20th AugustVery very pathetic display quality. Even HD channel is not clear. Colour spread all over the places, completely Blurry display. Sound is also poor. Very noisy sound quality. This isnt expected from One plus. Contacted amazon they said TV can\\'t be returned on the basis of display quality. Felt cheated, and for one plus lovers, a big disappointment.Date 24th AugustAfter inspection by Amazon authorised Agent, the return has been accepted. Thank god I got rid of this mess.,Just got my 43\" TV delivered.... Installation went on well and it worked fine till the service person was giving demo.... The time he left, screen stopped working and i could only hear the voice and with the screen in black.... Tried to connect it in all possible ways and finally with decided to register a complaint, hufff this is a big task again, no one responds to the calls and after a fightback of 5 hours finally they registered my complaint and scheduled for technical  evaluation after 3 days.... Worst experience and worst service...... I dont recommend such irresponsible company products.....,Got this product delivered on 6th Nov 2020 . By March 2021 the device became faulty. Contacted amazon customer service and they promised to send a technician within 48hrs. Unfortunately no one contacted us or came to us for servicing the device. So contacted the customer care again and received the same reply that they will send the technician within 48hrs . Today a person rang me from OnePlus and said that the technician will come within a week. So whom should I believe. Before this incident I had huge admiration for OnePlus but now if any one asks me I will not recommend OnePlus,Everytime I switch on the tv I need to change date and time to today\\'s time so that the TV works.Else it won\\'t be connected to WiFi. I have called multiple times the OnePlus executive but they also couldn\\'t do anything and give some false promises.I tried calling OnePlus for replacement but they denied. I don\\'t what is the issue here.Moreover even after changing remote 3 times I cannot switch on the TV with the Remote, I always need to switch on the TV from behind the tvWorst experience with the TV. Just horrible,The price for this product is good.But the disadvantage in this tv are :1. Poor remote signal2. Unable to connect mobile to tv3. Sound Quality4. High Lag in SystemNot recommended to buy,Worst TV ever to buy.. manufacturing defect in the replaced product also and one plus denies to agrees for it and asking 10000 for repair of the product...fruad..even Amazon is denying the promise made to me to provide free of cost service after making promising me for service for whole one month...fraud by amazon n oneplus...never buy products from Amazon n one plus,Tv is not even switched on.  I have raised the request on 24 Aug 2021, But still din\\'t get resolved my problem. then i created request from One Plus TV service itself. but there also no response. the not even responding. worst service from one plus. Please don\\'t buy it.,Data saver mode is absent from my TV. This is the biggest setback for me. Although they are still showing data saver mode in product description on Amazon.Hope they fix this in their update.,It\\'s hangs a lot and it has only been less than a month! Every TV is basically the same these days. All the features are good except that the remote is terrible and it hangs a lot!,UI not smooth as they shown.Less ram, less internal storage makes UI worst.Don\\'t buy for OnePlus brand only (after sale service not good as their phones)For that same price iffalcon k31 (TCL brand)4K16gb memoryEspecially no lagging,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0The products wireless card started to malfunction just after 4 months of purchase and worst is that the oneplus customer care doesn\\'t even bother. I have raised the complaint and it has been 6 days.  I don\\'t have any response from oneplus care team. They just ask me to wait for few days.  Worst customer care ever. I would not recommend people to go for oneplus although the price is very tempting. But if we don\\'t get any after sea support,  this is of no use . Sony and Samsung are way better though they charge a premium.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Don\\'t buy this OnePlus TVOnplus lost my trustI bought 43 inches TV on 4th January but it\\'s not working from 14th January.OnePlus have the worst service, they are not proving any service to the customers.I was calling to the service center from last 10 days but they are not giving any response.This is the worst TV and worst service to the customers..There is no service center in Warangal even it is 2nd biggest city in Telangana after Hyderabad..Online service and local services are also worst in OnePlus..Don\\'t go for OnePlus because they are not providing any service to their customers...,I am reviewing the product after using it for 3 months..till now the performance of the TV is good enough..Pros:-Good picture quality-Sound is also good enough-Cools looks-Good featuresCons:-Sometimes works slow-Software glitch happens sometimes, need to power off & on to deal with itOverall a good TV to purchase at this price,I got 43 inch version. Good at this price point.I had to replace it once. The first TV I got was on older OS version(updated on Jun), this was buggy and had lot of issues.- can\\'t update the OS- Update was not working- I wasn\\'t able to add Google account- YouTube was not workingBut, the replacement I got had new OS version (updated on Sep) and it resolved all above issue.It seems good and stable enough. But, still software improvements are needed.I am happy with sound quality and picture quality. Well good enough as per this price point.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Worst product from One Plus. Getting grains in the picture within 4 months. Is it worth buy for 15k. Compare other products are better.No response from service also. Don\\'t buy.,Useless product. If you’re remote conks then no replacement available even if you want to pay and buy. onePlus keeps saying that they don’t have it in stock so buy at your own risk.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0The TV is overall perfect picture quality and sound. The only question over here is of reliability, i bought this tv on 30 September but facing problems with it since then and when i raise a complaint it starts working fine automatically. And magically it occurs again after 1 month.Faced the issue again last week and this time the issue still existed when the service person came.Please see the video attached and decide. This video was taken by the service technician that visited. Overall i rate this TV 1 star because if reliability.,Dont buy this tm if you are looking for good display.i connected this to my laptop and the quality of the display is so bad.you can clearly see pixel and it is blurr.its only good for sound and app feature.. not for display,TV Not working from Day Two Onward, contacted One Plus Through Amazon for  Service no Res ponce from Company Side and Amazon side also , Finally They Cancelled Service RequestTV with me but not working, waste of MoneyDon\\'t Buy,I had a lot of expectations, but iam disappointed. The picture and sound quality is good. But the software is very very very bad. Maybe because it\\'s just 1 GB ram.It\\'s gets stuck intermittently. It gets shutdown on its own. It keeps coming out of the apps like YouTube on its own,Tv display is damaged in 15 day, i can understand in machinary it happen but after one month brand is not repair it. this is the concern.  I have reached to Amazon they also not helped and say we are not responsible brand will give resolution on this. I am waiting waiting and waiting. when techinician will can and repair. If it will not resolved in next 10 days then last option is Consumer court.,Remote is not working properlyPoor Picture QualityWorst Soundan entry level TV where you don\\'t mind quality. never expected worst product form company like ONE Plus,Do not buy this product as it\\'s quality is worst.There are bugs (small insects, ants) entering into the display and roaming freely inside it. Please see the picture I attached with this review.I am trying to contact customer care for last 3 days but no reply from their side as well. I feel like i have wasted 13000 on this product.,Worst ever....after 10 days of purchase , TV is not starting, raised issue in amazon and they denied service , raised to 1+ ,they are also making excuses since complaint raised. Still counting days and no one has shoen up till now.....more than a month passed since complaint raised.,Picture quality was goodSoftware running smoothlyLike it very muchBut within a day display started problems like flickering white,May be I got defective product I think so I returned it,I bought the TV on October 15 and intalled on 25th October..But, On December 18th. The TV showed display error and i requested a service via amazon. But literally there was no response form them for these three days,It has everything to offer in this price range, but the only issue i see in the device is it is slow something that I can\\'t even change the application or go back to the menu again...But that occurs like  1 or 2 times a day.. other than that i guess its a very nice product in this price range.,Tv was very good in terms of picture quality. Sound is manageable to some extent. Internal featutes and wifi everything works pretty good. In remote two of the buttons were not functioning but voice wise it is able to recognize but, tv is quite lacking.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0My opinion is to not buy this tv why because.. I have faced an issue with the wifi connection as it disconnects automatically as shown in the video. I have changed it once under warranty but after a couple of weeks the issue still exists.. So go for MI or Realme smart tvs. Oneplus is lacking in their quality and services. If you have any other go to sell the product please go ahead and buy something useful.,Two Conditions faced in last 10 days1. Wifi connection in TV is not stable, same wifi in other TV and devices won\\'t give problem. However in 1plus TV it keeps on disconnecting.2. Often shows home screen without pressing any button on remote while binging shows over internet,Good,Tv was not what was shown in the description. Whole plastic body was looking very cheap, besides the rate was also cheap, but at first i thought one plus would not deliver cheap product even at cheap price, but i was proved wrong.I returned the tv as there was some technical issue where tv was showing blue screen when turned on after few hours in standby mode, and only solution was to turn it off completely and then again turn on, so finally i decided to get rid of the tv and as there was no replacement available i got a refund.,Writing this review after 10 months. Don\\'t buy this tv. The quality for display is very poor. I\\'m using oneplus and vu tvs. When comparing with oneplus, VU tv\\'s display quality is far far better. And I got bright and dark spots in display after 10 months of usage. I\\'ve called for service it is more than a week, but no response from the service team. There are still asking for more time. Better go for VU.,Don\\'t Bought this onle plus  TV .Some features are not working ( mobile mirror, voice assistance) so i have sent replace request after that replacement i got defect /damage product refer enclosed pic.. Now a days amzon selling worst product i am experience few products recently 😔,I ordered this during the festival sale. This product was delivered and installed on time. Coming to the product the HDMI ports were not working properly. One port wasn\\'t working at all and I was seeing a pinkish screen on the other port. Amazon didn\\'t let me replace the tv and I had to reorder the tv at ₹ 1000 higher price than before. The new tv was delivered after more than 10 days.  And the installation date provide was one week after that. So for getting a working tv I had to wait for 24-25 days. The service provided by amazon during this festival sale was no where near the mark set up by them previously.,Product was very good but had worst blasting speakers.. one plus does not have good customer service for TV. Since it was manufacturing defect Amazon took return. Else one plus customer service was non existent. Learnt a big lesson. Better to spend 1k more and go for Samsung,Poor Quality TV at low cost.Poor display.Poor sound quality.Extremely slow procesor.You can not see the TV for long time.Not a eye friendly.Delivered with damage display.Returned the same.Amazon should stop selling poor quality product to maintain their quality standard.,OnePlus has rolled out a perfect TV , like it\\'s phones. Good picture quality, display, UI and remote. Direct option to switch to youtube, Netflix , primevideo. The Google assistant works perfectlyNeed bit improvement in sound quality.Best pacy in least price,It is One Plus! No need to write anything. Picture quality is good. Everything is good. It comes with android. You will never get this type of product in this prise tag! I\\'m making this statement after through market research.But internal video player could be better. It never resumes your playback!Overall Im fully satisfied and happy with my decision.,Picture quality is okayish.No 5ghz connection support.Audio quality is so poor that you may want to return the tv back.Installation is poorly done by 3rd party service & costs 400/- for wall mounting.I would suggest to add some more money and go for Samsung, Sony or Panasonic.Don\\'t get tempted by price.Poor quality from oneplus, didn\\'t expected that.,From the starting itself  i.e  from April 2021 it started showing problem with light and some time hanging problem. Now no picture is visible. Only sound Please send service engineer to repair it immediately,My overall experience with the product for 2 days, it\\'s very bad. Tv is not working properly. Remote doesn\\'t work and you can\\'t do anything about it. Picture quality is very poor. You won\\'t get REPLACEMENT from amazon. Shell out extra 3K and purchase from reputed brands, never ever dream to go for OnePlus. Be cautious, you will not get any product support from amazon and you have to live with a defective product. Visit a nearby showroom and purchase from them..this is what I wish to do right now :( after living with a defective product. Atleast you don\\'t need to worry about after sales support.,The product is good.. but there are few bugs in oxygen play. Every time you have to pair Bluetooth speaker to connect, which is annoying! You are in unpair- pair device loop often.The picture quality and perfomance is best in class. The software experience is seamless. I am expecting these minor bug fixes in software update.,One of the best lcd tv at this price range.Update on my after sales support: it is the worst after sales support that I ever experienced compared to other brands during pandemic. Took almost 1.5 months to get my panel replaced.,The Tv is really impressive in all aspects, haven’t tried the voice recognition and other smart features because it has just arrived. Happy with the delivery within two days of placing the order. Butter service by the providers are pathetic. The scheduled installation date was fixed but nobody came for the installation. Though I don’t need installation etc but just wanted to know the service but I am really very disappointed with the service by the service providers,This is the slowest TV I ever used.Don\\'t waste your money.Pathetic display clarity.Remote functions are dead slow.Amazon refused to offer HDFC cash back.Contacted many times. Amazon Agents are irresponsible and still it is pending.,Really worst service from one plus, I have purchased just 2 months before, it\\'s always internet connectivity issue, I logged a complaint 20 days before but still issue not sorted. Still saying we will come and we will resolve.Really I was not expecting this kind of support from oneplus, it has failed in television catagory,This is the worst smart tv that would be available in the market, with just Netflix Hotstar and YouTube installed the tv hangs. Takes ages to switch from one app to another.Picture and sound quality is poor.Remote stops working and the TV needs to be restarted to pair the remote again.,I am using this TV since two weeks .My honest review -One of the best picture quality and good designed like premium looks.I could see may reviews about sounds quality. My personal experience is sound is  so good .. it was clear and there is no any noise.The one part i faced the issue is  screen mirroring it was very bad ..I unable to connect screen mirror with one plus connect application.I am connecting through 3 party app.,Into one month everuthing was working fine... But now the HDMI port got compliant... It take 2days for amazon to arrange technician to come.. After that its now 5days... Till now waiting for spare parts to come....Hope everything will be covered by warranty....Edit 1.Its nov 10th still tv is not repaired... Even amzon customer care people dnt knw what to do with this warranty...Please dont buy this tv.....,I Purchased the product last month in Diwali sale and overall I am satisfied with the product quality. But in comparison to the other brand\\'s like MI,  Realme etc price is on the little higher side, If the rice is a little bit lower side it will be a higher selling product.,I\\'m received this TV on 27th june today is 3rd July still the installation team didn\\'t came I have only 4 more days to make replace(if any issues), on my schedule date that technician called me asking for money for installation, here they mentioned free of installation, next schedule is showing for 7th June and that is the last date to replacing option for this TV try to change the process otherwise please stop your brand,Best in this price range .we can expect moreI am using since 10 of july undoubtedly picture quality is too good sound is also good as compare to other brands.There is an issue while opening any app, i think it will get optimized after next update  that they are providing in September.,I am a Prime customer and usually order all my electronics and other stuff from Amazon and I am happy with the services. One Plus Y series was a Nice Deal but during the order there was no clear guidelines for Amazon Eco Dot offer and I ordered as per the details mentioned there but I did not get Eco Dot and I contacted customer care but they were also not able to get me the offer. I am a Prime customer but disappointed with my experience with this order. I have read the terms and conditions during that time and it was not present and later on added by seller or Amazon.,The screen cast is not supported by the TV.It\\'s been 2months for the TV and the display started to flicker with a black line vertically on the display.Further the repair/ return service against the warranty is not very customer friendly, I\\'ve been trying to avail the warranty service but no positive response received from the other side.,Please don’t make a mistake purchasing this device as mine stopped working within a month of purchase. Even the remote control is faulty and shuts the TV down just by pointing towards with without any button press.The service centre guys will not respond to the complain for more than 15 days. They won’t even respond either.,Edited ..after 6month to 1year:Tv can\\'t start without remote, and remote is of such a dull quality which don\\'t connect with TV after a lot of efforts,  lm genuinelyNOT recommended to anyone to buy this TV even if TV you got free of cost..24000rs TV ,Android  But Without Wall mount.No use . Ok quality.Bad Experience.,This TV don\\'t have any setting which could set HDMI (any other) Input as default Input.So everytime to switch off/on the TV, you need to set the input to HDMI to tune to your DTH setup box. So your parents/grand parents will find it difficult to use this TV.This simple feature is available in every other competetior TV like MI, Sony, TCL, Samsung etc.,Its having software issue, the date and time changes every time when we switch off the TVI was return and get another one, but it is also same software issue....I dont like this,Got the Oneplus TV during deals and was delivered on time and its working as expected except the installation service which was bad though not necessary as we went ahead with setup on our own and its working fine as of now. Will post further reviews upon observing in a couple of weeks or months.,Awesome product !!!! Like you can\\'t have a better tv in such low price !!!! No problem with my tv .... Pehle we were scared ki tv agar kharaab aai to ??? But delivery was awesome ..... Installation vas FAB !!! This tv is more than 20-25 thousand in shops .... Par yaha  pr perfect aur budget friendly price hai ... Loved it ❤️💫 Just go for it guys !!! 💋🔥✌🏼 Picture quality is amazing and sound system is also wonderful !!,Feel like Ordinary tv. Not any more surprising from one plus brand. Picture quality it\\'s unsatisfying. Major issues for unsatisfying for 32inch tv promotion through amazon actually size is different it\\'s 29inch of measurement size from actual 32inch tv size i meant full screen and total tv size. Feel very very common and Irdinery tv. It\\'s not look like a famous brand. Am sorry to say but this is a fact and feel. Thank youBy Manikandan k,1.It\\'s very worst product.2.Don\\'t buy this product.3. Service is very very worst4. Warranty claim also delay for the product.5. Tv spare parts not available6. Customer service person also delayed for this issue,Attracted towards OnePlus brand and bought this tv for 13k which was 4k higher than similar products in other brands...from the day one USB port not working and the delay in technical service was horrible ..day after day rescheduling happens and irritating over no of phone calls... replacement will be given after collecting the defective product by the time have already paid 2 months emi... Very bad experience with Amazon and pathetic one plus tv,T. V.  Hangs and voice command does not work. Moreover free installation is a big lie.. Technician who came to install the t. V.  Has no idea of android t. V.  Voice command instaed they forced us to buy wall mount saying it was mandatory. We denied it as they were charging rs.  750 whose price in amazon is much lower. Very poor installation service.we did it ourselves,Better options are available. This tv is called smart tv but cannot connect to 5g and can\\'t mirror cast freely.  You will have to buy google chrome cast for the same.,Will recommend don\\'t buy smart tv from amazon at least, coz the worst product and service anyone can get from amazon will be this. Within one month the product stopped working and not getting any help from amazon. Just pathetic service and faulty product.,I would suggest please dont but oneplus tv which is terrible in terms of usage...I am using from the last 7 months and it got repair issue twice and service takes uptown 1 month to repair the TV ...worst product I have ever seen in my life ...please dont buy from Amazon as well....,I never expected to write a negative review for OnePlus Product!I love OnePlus but I hate that TV because poor build quality.1. White edges on bottom of Tv and Screen Flickering is the most common problem2. Half of the times, TV doesn\\'t start with a single button press.3. Booting takes atleast 20 seconds4. Screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time.6. System lag is the maximum in this class of TV\\'s,Echo dot doesnt work with the TV as advertised and is awaiting a software update so buying an echodot as a bundled offer with the One Plus TV is not helping . The TVs picture quality can be a bit better and really not upto the Mark as it is advertised. The TV apps is a bit slow and hangs at times . The Remote functioning is not as agile comparing a VU or any typical brand . Overall not a pleasant experience and  not expected from One Plus. I have a feeling Oneplus is compromising on the quality at various ends .,Nice product at this price. Quality of picture is very nice. Has got all the smart features. Voice recognition is also good. For that make sure your internet is has good singnal. Sound quality is not good. For that you have to buy sound bar. I am giving this review after a month. As if now I have not got any issue yet. But at this price I will recommend to buy OnePlus TV,Gap between frame and screen. Disappointing1. Sound quality is very bad2. Build quality is very bad,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0There is no doubt about picture quality it\\'s one plus product..Just go for it..after Apple one plus is the only company has most trustable about quality and performance...I am planning to buy another one on next sale...,Picture quality is good. Issues with sound quality, but on customizing the sound from settings, the sound quality improves a lot. At this price point, it is quite good. If one is happy using YouTube, AmazonPrime, Netflix, which are pre installed, you are not going to face any issues of lag.Most importantly, found \"Made in India\" written on the back panel of the TV. So, one can prefer this product from other available at same price range.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Product is good but pictury quality is not as expected.I feel MI smart tv picture quality is better than this OnePlus Tv (my opinion because some people feel that OnePlus tv picture quality is better than MI tv). Connectivity is good. It runs android 9 with built in playstore.,One of the best Smart TVs out there. It isn\\'t 4K but no compromise in the picture quality whatsoever. Just a little bit slow, but again, at this price point, and other features (the remote is great, and voice recognition and Google assistant works great), it can be ignorable. Also the sound quality is enough to fill a decent hall. Chromecast and pairing devices are really smooth.,I seriously recommend you not to purchase one plus products TV, in 20 days it got problem with blank screen and flickering, from last 3months I am behind customer care and service centre guys. No one till the day is responding  and even after more than 30 mails sent to support team. OnePlus is not supporting any tv which is purchased fron Amazon as they said.,Sound quality needs to be improved.. and you can use HD only less than 1TB which is major disadvantage. Any USB device more than 1TB will not work.Good installation team..supportive & helpful.,It has very great picture quality, rich sound, and all of the smart features available in present. It also has support for voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, you can assign commands through your voice.The TV runs on Android TV 9.0 operating system, so apart from regular content, you can stream content directly from other online platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime and YouTube.,It is a china product. Material and voice is worst than kids toy. It hangs after 15 days....  Worst support for claim.... Support team only wasting time... Warraty repair request automitically finished without service...  I m going to wait for a week otherwise going to throw this into dustbinToday on 15 decAmazon person telling that service to be provided by company and company technician without any service without clearing claim finished the claim... Ridiculous,I bought this product because all my family members have 1 plus phones...but was very disappointed with the remote control...the sensor is very poor..i have to literally get up each time and go close to the tv about 10cms apart and use the remote... which is really irritating.. they should work on this issue,Product of one plus 43” Tv was good But the customer service is worst of Amazon if you buy a tv in Amazon the installation will done for year or more days it will take and then they tell us to do installation of our nearby technician they tell us to give money to them we will pay you in Amazon pay balance but also they doesn’t pay and they always tell us update in 48 hours something up to now it happened one month so I tell you to don’t buy in Amazon,Facing many lagsSound(voice is low, back ground voices noisy nd  disturbing) while watching any showsDisplay little FlickeringPicture more saturatedRemote connectivity slowSuddenly it\\'s restartsVery laggyMany bugsOne plus(waste)I ordered product aug 14.. But untill now no installation ..installation team will escape ny saying false statements.So finally after 20 days i got installation by my own.. amazon will provide money for installation just 500(amazon pay balance)No proper response from amazonBetter go for high end models,Sometimes apps or programs is strucking. It will take time or we will switch off the TV to restart. App will not not close automatically if another app is running. Some disappointed,All features are good, 15 days remaining for my device warranty and its display is gets black. worst experience with OnePlus, I brought this device because I am using OnePlus 7 pro Mobile. I it\\'s customers service not even pick up my call.Very disappointed.,Simple trick to hang the TV.Play any vedio on YouTube.Off the TV frm remote.On the TV frm remote.The OnePlus Y series TV get hang, noting works unless you unplugged and plugged in again.Plz try with your One Plus Y series TV and share your feed back.The TV software is not properly tested and launch in Market. Some time screen get blur, only volumes come and pictures get hang.It takes 10 to 15 sec to start.Waiting for any Upgraded patch from OnePlus expecting to be fixed with software upgrade.Picture and sound quality is good.,Good to watch movies in in tv .I bought an 43 inch tv at price of 25k. Only draw back is sometimes is becomes slow or screen gets a lag and it came back to home screen.,No wall mount attached to this TV. Bad installation experience,Worst product .. dont buy this one .i know its very cheap but plz dont waste your money . Its been the 1st night my remote is not being able to switch on the tv ...it lags/hangsup many times a day sound quality is worst.. go for any other brand  but not one plus .. never expected this third grade quality product. There\\'s even a colour fluctuation while playing the video sometime and its not even two days..,You will get what you pay for, i had high hopes at first and ordered it through amazon.The installation service by one plus is satisfactory but the television is where it all spills, it will work properly for the first couple of months and then the experience gets really laggy.The contrast is really bad and the sound quality is average.It is a one time investment, please go for sony or Samsung by spending more but dont buy this.2 stars out of 5.,Worst tv worst customer service my tv stopped working with in two days due to some software issue service centre people also very unprofessional and Dehradun service centre have no knowledge about tv softaware they are failed to resolve the issue which is still pending.,please dnt buy .. i am giving this review after using it for 6 months but i am facing the issues from day one the tv hangs all the time and its really slow .. when i asked amazon to fix it i was told by the technician the system will update in few days and after that is will work properly .. after updating it twice its same .. dnt your waste money i thought its one plus brand so i bought it but regretting now ..,SOUND -: The most disliked thing is the sound of Y serie and one more thing is the speaker comes without tweeter ,its like local speakers voice.PICTURE QUALITY-: Good  ( 4.0of 5.0)Value for money -: this comes for the ones budget under 25k.Oneplus connect - is a lit bit laggyFull plastic body not a even metal used in the body,I bought this television October 2020 within one year suddenly display dissapered that\\'s ok it in warranty so I want to replace it but the worst part which is I dint expect from one plus is very worst service for television it\\'s been 2months till now no repair just calling up customer service still they will never get back to me my serious recommendation is not to go for one plus TV and I will end,Tv looks premium and slim and very light weight.Voice it low than usual . Inbuilt speaker is too low even for small room . You need to use extra Bluetooth speaker . But what else you expect in this price. I got this in 12k which is serving purpose overall.,I am not at all satisfied with the picture quality. also there is a fault in the remote. not at all happy with the product. The TV installation person came when the return window was closed. This is not expected from Amazon. this is disgusting I want to return this product.,Do not buy this product the dealer is delieviring old items from the godown, i have purchased one it it\\'s display is scratched. When i call amazon customer help they denied to replace item and call me that you have to check when item is delievered, that was so minor how can we confirm in once. Please by from the local shops istead of amazon.,The product was amazing...picture quality was so good,sound quality of the tv is good.But the tv not connecting with the mobile and Google assistant is of no use and it\\'s not connecting to the device.

Bad warranty  Service.Please don\\'t buy it from amazon for their eye catching offers. It always good to go n buy from your nearest shop.,Don\\'t buy this TV... Not even 40days.. display is gone. poor service from Amazon to claim warranty.As long as all good Amazon will be right choice. if any problems, they will not take care on the priority.  It\\'s been 10days no action taken by them. Same I have been seeing from other customers as well. If they got an any issues, very difficult to get it fix or claim warranty.,Unable to connect tv remote app on phone.TV looks great.

Am i a fool to keep waiting for 15 days after paying and even giving my old tv in exchange. Very bad service and very bad product.,after one month i see lot of issues, build quality is not good, face issues with remote, finally now facing issue with video display, support team is not user friendly it\\'s been two weeks i raised complaint no one is taking care.my recommendation : in 13000 we don\\'t have to expect much but if it works for atleast 6 months i would have recommend the product but i see the difficulty in 2nd week itself, so save money and go for guarantee product instead of OnePlus.,The picture quality is not up to the mark conpared to the other models of similar price, the size of the tv is small, poor sound quality,,Tv picture quality is awesome 👌 but gotten defective display screen become white suddenly.Unable to give rating because it is defeated.Bad luck ☹️,One of the worst product I have never seen we watch tv only 10 days after that automatically switch off not powering on no proper service please don\\'t buy the service is very very very worat& worst from OnePlus I gave complaint one month ago upto now I didn\\'t get any response please don\\'t buy OnePlus products worst products,The sound quality is not good.. not clear at all to understand a conversation.While playing YouTube or Prime or any online site, this unclear sound output becomes more difficult to understand.,The picture quality is superb for that price point i am giving 3 stars only because everything is good except1) no data saver mode and doesn\\'t even support when u trying to update from play store2) tv lags a lot of times not very fluid3) the sound from the inbulit speakers is very very avg,TV is excellent when it comes to picture quality and sound but comes with few issues.1. Google assistant is not easily operational2. Installation is said to be free including wall mount but the installation guy came and asked for Rs 2500 for wall mount bracket so I didn\\'t wall mount it.Good thingsPicture quality,One of the worst experience i got from this product.

I have been using the tv from almost a monthNo issue detected running perfectly fine. Picture quality is awesome sound is good. Smart features are as android TVs have just sometimes remote takes time to operate otherwise it\\'s  worth every penny. And yes you have to be patience like very... for the installation process!,After 6 month , I am still love to watch tv with OnePlus y series , earlier I wished to brought U series but u series wasn\\'t available so i have brought Y series ,But it is truly love in it , yeah still some bugs are there but I am happy to ignore it , my best experience is swich off the room lights and  tv brightness or tv ground light works good and a glass of 🍻 made  my tv experience good .,Item was defective. And more about it was ridiculous experience with Amazon. Without came to installation they changed it to service completed. And when I raised query then, service person came after so many calls.  So I suggest never buy it again from Amazon.,The Y series Oneplus Tv is the worst when it come to the performance.Sound System is poor for standard size hall , it lags too much , .The input ports are not proper, It doesn\\'t recognise sometimes the input device.Picture Quality is Ok Ok!The device lags too much which makes the picturequality look bad.The services of the OnePlus Tv is the Worst.One Should not buy OnePlus TV Y series .Go for the Trusted TV brands,First of all Thank You Amazon and One plus..

Amazon is just playing with us fromThe last 2 months, apparently the TV has some missing motherboard parts and the warranty claim people doesn’t lift the call! If you are looking to spend your money on a TV which should last long? Then this is definitely not it!,If you want a genuine review and if you are looking for sound quality then don\\'t buy it and rather go for MI 32Inch smart tv I has all the things (I own one) .SOUND- NOT GOODTHIN SCREEN - GOODPICTURE QUALITY - GOODOVERALL - 3.5 STAR ⭐⭐⭐✨,POOR SERVICING/ FRAUD SERVICING COMPANY/ THEY NEVER CHANGED THE FAULTY PARTS / NO ONE RESPONDS TO CALL AND EMAIL/ AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE JUST REPLIES IN AUTOMATED RESPONSES / DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,Met my expectations. (Ratings relative to the price segment)1) Good Build quality  (4/5)2) Beautiful Display. Rich in colours (4.5/5)3) Fair Sound quality (3/5)4) Smooth Android experience (4.5/5),We are used to bulky television sets. When this set arrived and was unboxed, it had an air of non-seriousness. It looks like a large touch-screen mobile phone. But once you switch it on, it packs quite a punch in terms of the screen quality. The remote is very user-friendly. I have an issue with the sound though. It\\'s not that great. But for the money I paid for this product, I can\\'t expect everything to be perfect. Overall a decent product.,Sound quality is poor i.e below average . picture quality is whitish little bit as MI tv .more over Amazon is giving worst service after having 2 slot bookings service person will come and tell that it is not free of cost we need to pay for wall mount stand and that to MI wall mount or else he will regret to come . Then after calling to  Amazon call service center and none will give proper replay very poor service by Amazon they will make us fools by taking complaint .,the  product is worth of buying, the price of the tv is  comes around 13-14k , comparing to the other brand . one plus gives standard and quality  product. I am giving this review after one year the warranty period is over and  still there is no problem with product .amazon provided the installation on the same day of delivery , I appreciate  amazon for it .!!,Never buy this TV, I have bought with 23K . After 10 days TV Display is not working . I am behind service care to get repair this . TV was delivered on 15th Sept. I have raised a complaint on 3rd October but still no action taken either from Amazon or Oneplus. Very bad decision made by me . Regretting .,TV is good.I hated the surprise billing demanded on installation for items amounting Rs 700 .This cud have been told to me properly ,rather than being a surprise item.,Speaker quality is horrible.Since they have back speakers it should be kept in an open space and not in any kind of closed space or something that has back covered. Also this wasn’t mentioned in the details which is a little disappointing.Resolution is okayish feels more of 720 rather than 1080.Recommended for watching regular movies and shows but not for gaming.,Picture quality is too good. Also the gap btwn the display and the outer boundary is a little bit, which looks awesome in full hd. Sound quality is avg. I suggest add a sound bar of boAt. About Posting and packaging I have no words..... Just amazing. the remote is inbuilt google voice assistant which helps too much. Overall awesome product. Worth it !!!,The TV is perfect in this price range.Video quality is very good you can play videos at 1080p in full HD.Smart features are quite excellent.One thing that you can see very less bezels and TV is so slim and attractive.overall TV IS Excellent but oneplus should improve their speaker sound its not upto the expectation.sound improvement should be their.,Worst tv full of hang, no proper streaming.Disgusting so please please I strongly recommend don’t buy at all. Look for something else,1 there is no wall stand you have to pay extra.2 if you are installing an new app like airtel xtream or sony live it is not installing i am very frustated now feeling like waste of money.3. now after 15 days u can not return it back.4. guaranty will not work in this installation issue I was wrong i trusted this Chinese tvplease dont buy .....,Many things are poor or not user friendly feature, eq. Screen mirroring, wifi connectivity , switching, remote is working just like very slow or bad functionality etc :(Just putting comments for other mango man to take right smart tv instead of this.,One plus led quality very poor .And bottom beading not proper stick with tv screen so occure focusing issue .We raise the complaint.and prob attend by technician. He told this is manufacturer defect comes with one plus led tv always.in my home other led tv sony brawia . In this sony tv beading proper fits with body . Technician told me not compare with sony. One plus is a low brand.,I got delivered damage product  and also found missing accessories  in which no remote, guide book and battery found,, even when I applied for return, first person who came for pick , mis behave with family and leave damage piece in my stairs, then I complained again and another pick up guy came today and he took with him that damage piece,Worst experience , low quality cheap build , go for vu tv or mi tv for better experience , connectivity is very poor ,not even usb port is connecting properly , Google voice assistant is not working, dolby atmos poor cheappp... Worst display panel , blindly purchased tv for the brand OnePlus ,but totally disappointed...... Not user friendly DON\\'T BUY ONEPLUS TV...... only OP\\'s smart phones are good not any other gadgets...,Reviewing this product after using 6 months performance is really very good  ,  it\\'s elegant look and sleek design enahance the feel of viewing but OS updates needs to be done which will enhance the quality and performance , worth buying . smart purchase from Amazon ..happy with the one plusBlutthooth feature can be improved,The  tv remote does not function fast.  It is slow to remote commands. Plus remote does not have a sleep function. Overall performance of the tv not very satisfactory.,It lags in between and when we play ps4 it hangs every 30 seconds. It goes off stating No signal and comes back..even after software update..Not much Happy overall..Felling bad that I went for this when I had better options..,Very disappointed with the product.Remote is not getting paired at all. I have tried other bluetooth device to pair but tv not showing anything. I tried many times in different way also but it is same as before.,When I read the negative comments on the reviews I thought people are expecting 60k tv features in 22k budget TV, so I thought it would be good for its price range. But when the product got delivered, I realised buying this TV is a mistake.Build quality worst you won\\'t feel worth of the money you spent on the TV. Remote control is another disaster.Overall, better to go for alternative.,After using it for a month I am writing this review. The tv is working properly and its picture quality is great sound quality is great. Amazon Tv installation service is very poor it\\'s one star worthy. I waited for 4 days for the engineer to come and install but no one came to install the tv.,DONT buy this product.Wost servicewhat can I do? the line appears on the screen after 15days of purchase.I placed a warranty issue and still, it doesn\\'t resolve. after one month, amazon Cancelled the warranty claim.Don\\'t buy on plus tv. their service is poor and support from amazon is worst.It\\'s around  7-8 months, My problem is not resolved,First of all its not a 32inch it\\'s a cut sizeNot working voice recognitionNot looking one plus brand it\\'s defiantly china assemble item only one plus using nameIn my opinion one plus loose ur brand valueIf I compare to realme and miOne plus is less than other product,The picture quality is so crisp , I can actually feel it is like 4k , though it\\'s not completely 4k.The sound is far better than most of the already popular brands .The remote response is amazing.Total worth 🤘🤘,The hdmi while playing ps4 goes black and comes back again within secs. This was the only problem, otherwise a great product.,So far going to good after 3 months of use. Initially i thought i did a mistake Buying a TV for monitor use as the text’s  was not as sharp as in the monitor, but later i figured out the option called “pc mode” which provides clear text like monitor. Thats a cool feature. Felt happy.,Door delivery has not done, I personally went Amazon store and Tv is ok but remote is not workingYour technician has tell that it will replace Tommorow, but till now I didn\\'t received any call from Amazon and brand companyPlease help us to get the remote immediately,After ending of the return period my tv has this Straight black vertical line problem.,Picture quality is amazing and overall worth the price. Remote initially lags but later on it works fine. There was an issue with tv connecting to internet, when complaint was raised with oneplus cx care, no technician visited to rectify the issue after several followups. TV wall mount was not given free with TV which costs 1800 extra for adjustable one.,Writing review just after 5 months : Screen flickering and green lining. So sad with one plus. I have been using its phone which works fantastic but will never recommend android TV,Within a week of installing the tv we started seeing picture issues. When reported, the technician said it was an issue related to the set top box. So we got that changed as well. Still the issue didn\\'t go away. After a couple of months, the tv started restarting on its own every 10 minutes or so. We did everything on the troubleshoot list, nothing works. Worst purchase ever.,Great product manufactured by OnePlus. Great deal given by Amazon. Hassel free exchange by Amazon.,Everything is good.Wonderful display but remember it\\'s full hd display if you come closer you can find noticeSound is good when you change settings into dolb digital,but iam getting crackling sound from left speaker , I booked service if they solve the problem no problem otherwise I will go for replacementConnectivity also good only you feel laging when you do screen mirroring through wifi,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0I can see white bulb inside and display look dusty (patches inside the display). Maybe used piece. Or something  faulty inside.Cant play 4k video with YouTube.this one average TV .not happy with one plus product,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0has power button problem with in 1 month when switching on in the remote it is not switching on after several attempts it is switching on,The picture and sound quality is very very good and you can literally purchase it if you look something in this budget than any other brand.Works with OnePlus connect. Response speed is also great. However you may face some problem with Chromecast. But overall It is LITERALLY WORTH BUYING,Never buy this tv from Amazon buy it from OnePlus because after delivery they don\\'t care about your installation it\\'s been a week my tv is just laying around and the installation is being reschedule on its own 3times not a single call from the technician and if you open the box your warranty is gone so never buy it from Amazon they don\\'t even care about the installation.,The TV is awesome buy for a budget smart TV. Lives up to the reputation of One+ Products. Sound output is not that excellent but overall a good product for it’s price segment. It’s definitely good option for a bedroom TV. It’s a ideal 32 inch is good for viewing distance of 8 ft. If your distance is more than 8 ft then please prefer a 48 inch Tv,Customer care can not be easily accessed and then no TURN AROUND TIME guidelines. Please do not buy. No repair available for 45 days now.,Really OnePlus ; USB drive not working properly in TV. FAT32 nit support; what to do ?Its bug and can fix by simple update but still not happen... Poor service,Its a 100% budget tv but dont expect it be sony . First sony is priced very high and it delivers according to it . To be honest i feel for this price range this is the best television packed with all features and also its One plus Tv so had a better goodwil than other tv\\'s in this range,This tv is the worst product in my i have ever bought. After 15 days of purchase it started malfunctioning and one plus dont any solution even after 3 months as they said that they have parts.Don\\'t purchase it as one plus not able to give service and i recommend to Amazon to remove this company from your portal,Tv build quality is very goood bt when come to its display part so much white and black spot found.Tv\\'s sound quality is really good and loud.Company like one plus this type of issus is not expected....I request amazon to replace my tv and they accept that tv have some problem on its display so they replace it ASAP.,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Waste of Money ,I purchase it on last August-20,Now disply of my tv not showing anything, without any reason. I just update system..n then disply gone wrong,So according to me instead of OnePlus u can for samsung or sony or else.Yes they r more costly then OnePlus but they r value for money...,Totally waste..from day one itself tv getting hanged...and more over remote not responding while power on. volume will too noisy when we increase.only good thing picture quality is good... don\\'t plan to buy this tv,Satisfy with this product...picture quality is superb & Dolby sound of this tv is amazing...voice recognition is very easy to use and very smart too..Bluetooth remote of this tv is goodOverall very good product..must buy,Waste many complainants automatically switching off go with mi TV it\\'s good the worsted tv I\\'ve seen I made many complainants in OnePlus customer care but they never responded and failed to send the technician even the technician dont have awareness about the tv and it\\'s program he\\'s just a hardware installer that\\'s all he don\\'t  have the quality to treat the problem,Good Android TV in the price range with decent picture quality and good sound quality. Impressed with the installation service by VECARE. The walmount was not a part of the package, however got it for free as a part of the free installation. The serviceman were v polite and professional. Amazon, like Flipkart, should work on better extended warranty deals. The Flipkart one is quite a deal at 800 for 2 extra years.,After using this product for a week, suddenly during usage of the tv, There were lines all over the screen. Trying reaching amazon customer Care and product provider from last one week but no one taking the responsibility of the product defect and I am not even contacted by the supplier. This issue is been occurring after 10 days, so customer care is just saying that we can not return the product. What should I do? Kindly guide.,Good product. One can purchase without much doubts. Volume and picture quality is good. Body quality, remote is good with smart features.Buyers should avoid getting waylaid by negative reviews. Value for money.Light weight, thin panel. Stand looks delicate for table top display if kids and pets around. Better to install on wall to avoid accidents.Overall satisfied.,Is this a fake not a dolby atmos speaker  voice quality is not clearity at high end volume  and remote is too much laggy too much slow work on tv and tv is also laggy after back on any app  and u want to  go home screen is time to take also 15 second \" badi  badi Baatey or vadapaun khate\" is that true dilounge for oneplus and 1 another problem amazon installation service is provided me wall mount stand of mi brand  not oneplus brand,The TV is very good to have as a secondary TV. The sound is great and the remaining qualities are simply superb... The picture quality is really good for a 32 Inch TV and the Bezel-Free design gives it a great look. Once the remote is connected, there is no problem with the voice recognition or the controlling... Overall a great product for very less price. Must Buy,Not value for money TV is not at par in comparison to other brands even in the mid segment poor picture quality and depth in color, low grade, Android  app is pathetic not a real product of one plus in comparison to the mobile experience,I had huge expectations with this One Plus Y Series TV but it turned out to be a huge disappointment for me.The screen was having black patches.,Bezels are very thin.,Sound quality is okayPicture quality is awesomeVoice recognition is delay for 1sec.. But it is okay at this price rangeAnd the remote control is very handy,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBad Experience...Bad Product...Bad Service.

Don\\'t buyGoogle assistant not working.  complaint 20+ times no solution,My one plus 32 inch tv not running properly today service man also visited and tell now your tv is updated at that time tv run on wifi but now it is wifi is turning on off automatically and not connecting,Installation services is to bad he was not fixing your septop  and also  i was requesting him sir plz can u fixed the septop boxx and also informing us about products operating details but he straightly telling no i am here for open and fix the but  he  is misser  and also  tv speed is too much slow but viewing quality is amazing and etc thing\\'s is also good but installation services is  useless 😟\\U0001f90f👎👎👎,The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Bought a wall mount bracket , it was movable and great by the installation person . Very much kind of him . Even though bracket has to be wall mounted , drilling on wall there wasn\\'t even a dust on the floor . Installer was using the drilling machine with dust collector.,It\\'s a good product by oneplus but the main problem was the TV INSTALLATION. Because of the pandemic it\\'s too late for installation of TV so it\\'s better to buy offline rather than buing online,Picture Quality is good, Sound Quality is ok, Smart Function not so good, very slow & Time consuming software, getting time to open the Apps. Overall Rating is value for Money,I had purchased 2 android tv from Amazon , after 2month used 1android tv was blank screen. I called the OnePlus customer care but I didn\\'t get any response. So I request all OnePlus customers don\\'t purchase any android tv from OnePlus I didn\\'t get any calls + I had lost my money also.Thankyou 🙂,Just got the TV delivered. A great product in 32 inch segment from the brand. Sound quality is good. Picture quality is superb as well. Remote is very smooth. Easy to set up by self. Build quality is also very good. Worth buying it as a entry level product. The only flaw i had witnessed is only HDMI port 1 support audio output.,Pathetic Picture Quality, its essentially an LCD selling as LED, an poor response from Amazon,buy some other brands and not from Amazon since they\\'re irresponsible,Stands are bit loose.....if u make your tv stand on legs on a table u feel so scared because the even after tighten up the screws well still they are moving.....and sound quality need to be improved the Dolby punch is missing,I like the TV pretty much,The picture and sound quality is the best valued at this price segment.But the only problem with the TV is depicted in the second pic i posted. I don\\'t understand why it\\'s happening when i change the channel for two seconds then it comes to normal🤷🏻\\u200d♂️,Very disappointing with this new product of One plus., Because screen not appear issue found within 2 months of purchase, And the service is poor , service center not available at nearby.Guys do not waist ur money to buy this.

After the warrenty it happened in 13th month again and having to pay out of pocket.,the tv has great picture quality and it is very hard and tasking to pair the remote control to the tv but for sound quality you will need speakers with a sub woofer as the tv sounds like 2 old toshiba laptops arguing over who gets to charge first,Ram is too less.Picture quality is poor only offers 720 PxSlow processorWhen done screen cast there is a lag between both the screens (phone and TV) which is again a problemDo not purchase this TV because you can have other brand TV in market in same price with better configuration,One plus tv and features are good. But As amazon showing combo with \"Alexa\". It\\'s not pairing. And there is 250 people who wrote about this on OnePlus site. Although cutomer care telling to contact oneplus . Although Amazon is promoting as Combo.,Could not have asked for more in this price. The tv is perfect just as one would expect from a OnePlus Device.But it is  better to get a soundbar with it for amazing sound.,Poor software optimization...

I have reset the TV, hope that fixes the issue,Very nice Tv in this price range from one plus.Picture quality is superb...Sound quality is ok ok but better than MI TV\\'sBuilt quality is also goodTv looks premium because of Bezel less design.Remote controller is also made of good quality plastic and it is very good looking,No wall mounted stand or at least screws (for stand) not providedUnsatisfied with thisuntil than tv is very good,Dont buy seriously telling you guys..instead buy mi or vu tv too many bugs in one plus tv netflux and chromecast not working properly .,Quality is good.ButIt lags while on and offScreen mirroring is not possible with Vivo phonesIt only works when external speakers has the hdmi supportChrome casting has issue, even when I disconnect the YouTube or wynk, it keeps playing on the TV screenHoping that Oneplus will have the OTA updates very soon to fix these issues,After sale service was worst.

       "'the media could not be loaded never expected to write a negative review for oneplus product screen flickering is the most common problem half of the times tv doesn t start with a single button press booting takes atleast seconds screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time audio is dud not sufficient for my x ft bedroom system lag is the maximum in this class of tv sedit amazon declined to replace and offered refund of as against k which i paid for the tv all i have to do now is to live with a defective tv as i had invested in the wallmount and the allied services oneplus settlededit product is back in stock amazon accepted for replacement after technician report but defective product is yet to be picked up and the replacement is yet to be shipped awaiting further details brand is not at all acting in the customers interest very bad response for oneplus edit received the replacement tv from amazon and the tv if working fine as of now i installed it on the wall by myself a bit of lag and sound issues but the screen stuttering is gone tv is beautiful with minute bezels i was pleased by the picture quality in firsti expected a smooth software from oneplus but tv operation is bit slow probably due to gb ram and lower clocked processor can t complaint at this price point wish oneplus would release better optimized software in update software update was one of my reason to buy tv from oneplus response from the bluetooth remote was bit slow but hold bluetooth was very functional might be as it is bluetooth tv was able to connect to devices at a time mobile bluetooth speaker and remote that s great coming to sound speaker quality isn t upto mark you have multiple options to enhance audio dolby surround presets dialogue enhancer etc probably that s the reason oneplus skipped mm output and opted for optical and hdmi arc ports to provide quality auido output on external speaker you should go rca audio adapters if you want mm input else connect to speakers using bluetooth adapter that would cost additional if you want to if you look for picture quality minimal design and stick to few ott app this tv is for you for power users and those who use only jack to connect speakers look else where update oneplus released major update and ui and remote control navigation seems improved now but setup of new bluetooth connection got buggy im not able to connect to new devices it is looping back to searching devices after clicking on device after search list ere is my experience with the oneplus laggy tv y model here is a list of issues with your product connected to samsung mobile through google home as the tv isn t connecting through samsung smart view always says unable to connect try again and even through the google home it is struggling too much to even cast the photos and forget about casting the videos neither windows nor mac is recognising the tv in wireless mode had to use third party app from play store to airplay my mac n gues what windows is not recognising the tv it is really shocking to see mac recognised where windows couldn t using third party play store app to my bad even through third party play store app it is laggy half of the times and how can i ignore to say about oneplus connect app its a wonders t app do the gesture wait for couple of seconds and then it responds and you can t access files through the connect app on this tv and sound it has options by the name dolby audio and dolby digital plus fix this in your mind these two features are just names and these does change the sound experience by zero percentage on youtube video quality is limited to p best to use hdmi cable to your happy and play k only then it felt better than any other video quality experience of this tv opening and closing apps is like suspense thriller movie scene experience you will be waiting to know when it will respond sometimes suspense extends to seconds viewing angles acceptable for this price colors green is worst of all and then red black is good blue colors are worst yellows are good and the rest that you find are acceptable display quality if any of you ever used the chinese phones of the last decade you will get the exact same feeling i promise you this best option to put good use of display and colors is to use pen drive hard disk or hdmi and play the k or full hd videos this is the only way that this display can make you happy and the remote the menu button literally never worked on any app nor on home page it just exists with void function assigned to it almost forgot about voice search that is google assistance out of times it took seconds to launch it opening an app fix in your mind that it will take at least once you connect bluetooth accessory you have to remove the device from the list if you want to connect it to other device you will not have an option to disconnect i will be brief here unboxing no wall mount no display cables plastic stands thin tv pros contrast ratio is amazing black level is amazing viewing angles r fine awesome colour accuracy latest android version cons poor quality speakers little bit laggy probably the os the panel is awesome tv won t lag when playing video and it s really okay android phones have similar issues as for speakers why would you use inbuilt speakers what matters most is contrast ratio colour range viewing angles and clarity they r all good in this price range no k k full hd tv could do better amazon installation i didn t get the wall mount cause installation guys were charging me for it tv is good amazon service is getting poorer after days usage display is good not best sound could have been better gamma engine not performed well ui is decent modern lightweight ui netflix amazon prime youtube and few apps are preloaded inbuilt chromecast performing well bezels design perfect best budget android smart tv major advantage of this tv is google assistant works like a charm everywhere and you don t have to type some bugs present in tv os first to review y as my experience with inch so far i liked the tv tv is by default on energy saving picture mode change to desire mode to get best picture experience as i changed many picture settings the picture quality is way better than mi realme me sound quality for my living room is more than enough dolby atmos work carm with my tatasky hd channels as they support dolby audio the lag is fixed to much extent last input memory is also fixed tv remembers the last input before switching off the installation was bit crisp as the guy didn t turn on the promised date so amazon escalated and yesterday new guy came and installated cherry on the cake the installation was free also the wall mount bracket worth rs was provided free by the installation team installed and the demo was given very promptly also to be noted this inches has different graphic processor than inches g mp updating my experience of days experienced lag nly twice in days tv takes a approx of min to get on there s a bit motion blur which would be fixed by update as it arises due to the dnr in the settings sound output is overall good at this range can t expect soundbar like bass pre book extended warranty has been activated and mail confirmation received from acko picture quality is just awesome with setting proper backlight contrast etc blacks are properly seen black this has va panel and i am not much concerned about viewing angles va panels are best for the straight view angle as they produce good contrast and color reproduction this tv does the same viewing angle can t be reviewed from my end as i did see blur when viewd at angle which is obvious for va panel data saver option and alexa support is yet to be updated in this tv as of now no alexa support for this tv as there s no option to login to oneplus account so my free echo dot is not of use with this tv as of now may be they will provide the update to this updating my review with some test done rgb colour gamat test is performing perfectly on this tv as you can see computer rgb reproduce proper color motion blur is too much in this tv expect to be fix via update tv remote is bluetooth and ir both i turned of my bluetooth of remote and using on ir as it s draining battery when on ir you can t use google assistant function no support for echo dot as of now confirmed hopefully will be in update no data saver option yet backlight bleeding is present at which is common for led tv color reproduction is good too updating my review to some clarification and my experience as echo dot is not compatible and no from oneplus has spoken about echo dot compatibility with y series i returned my echo dot for full refund those posting negative reviews due to echo dot not received kindly add echo dot from cloudtail in cart with oneplus tv u vll get it for free those posting negative reviews that after tv return oneplus gave nly rs please return your echo dot too they remaining approx rs will be refunded then only i connected my jbl sound bar and watched movies on prime i bet the dolby atmos did its work and its natural u can t expect soundbar sound at k pre book cashback of rs is credited to my amazon pay balance i got it delivered by july shipping was good but then bright spots started showing from the next day product quality isn t good too i advise you not to buy this oneplus tv s picture quality is good look feel is good i would quote best in this segment tvs i have explored most of the well noted brands in this price segment sound is with dolby digital plus enabled it is better tv build quality is good viewing angles are good too k videos will be reset to p and this is the maximum resolution for any video only gb memory is available out of gb oxygen play is useless there is bloatware instead of oneplus clean software motto accessing tv with oneplus connect app is out of its a disaster wall mount is free it will be brought by installation provider do not shell extra bucks for wall mount or installation apps take sec to open i am expecting optimization over next updates usb ports doesn t support fat memory sticks pendrive hard disk or phone i am disappointed for this one max viewing distance can be feet my vision is for both eyes though google play store is given you cannot install even google chrome i see only chinese apps are available even in google play store don t expect to install apps just like you do it on smart phone no issue with remote and response time is good too remote build quality is good too no heating issues noted so far supports only ghz band wifi no manual power switch if remote doesn t work it will be a hell with tv chromecast has sec delay which is very bad if you connect with laptop and work with mouse touch pad suggestion if price is not a issue go for samsung or lg suggestion want to enjoy premium experience buy premium tv do not expect to find it from chinese brands time is money the more time you spend in exploring the options and unboxing videos in youtube consider adding that amount to the tv you buy hope my review will be a help brilliant tv at affordable price first sale tv was returned back as it was defective one brought it nd time it s totally worth it the media could not be loaded product is on price k inch y pros nice picture quality awsm dolby surround soundno problem with casting with you tubecons croma cast from mobile laging connect app not working data saver not available in y after days after dwnlg oxygen plan from play store croma cast is working without laging connect app is also working now data saver not found to y one star because of poor installation servicei ve received a call of installation guy at am he said he ll be at location after hour so i said ok please come waiting of him after hours he didn t came stop picking the call suddenly after half n hour again i received the call he asked sir did engineer call you visit your place i saidhl he called me at am but he didn t come even not picking my call i m trying him alot after long conversation of half n hour he arranged another guy he gaves me the contact of another guy again i ve called him he is saying sir i ll be there after hour which is completely hard for me too wait i was getting late for office as you know the problem of covid offices fire there s worker well after talk to with him i ve send him location again he called me after hour said sorry i m not coming o asked why guy s word was talk to my boss brother who is your boss i would i know again after min i ve received call again sir i m visiting your place for installation i was surprised that whole amazon company engineers visiting my home well again min he called me said sir i m not coming wtf this whole scene was of am to pm then finally engineer came pm installated the led the whole wait was of only screws wow amazon please improve your service which is totally sucks i ve missed my office led performance is good but the speaker sound is not up to the marks picture quality is good tv is awesome at this price among all the competitors in this range of tv oneplus tv is best viewing experience sound performance fluenceall this upto mark i m giving star because of the following reason oneplus connect app is not working with tv i m unable to find any datasaver option available storage is less was eagerly waiting for this tv it s economically priced and i got it for k super thin and lite weight thin bezels and a absolute delight audio for a small room is great bigger room it seems to be quiet less been using it whole day just that one plus connect didn t work with my iphone and content from pendrive also not viewable at all not sure if it s supposed to be like that or there is some issue with the product called one plus customer care who told one plus connect won t work for ios and suggested to long press the home button and select one plus server to connect android and to my surprise ios also can get connected and works flawlessly moving on to the pen drive issue after a lot of research trial and errors it works only on the format fat the video quality is good but sound quality is average with marginal noise on higher volume i have viewed online content and seen dth tv they gives true colors and you will truly love it dolby sound quality is enough even for living room for dth opt for a dolby supported settop box i am using airtel xtream box k which is only for airtel thanks customer software lags at times and when you select live tv at times it will not start and gets back to homescreen was able to mirror cast through oneplus connect oneplus connect app helps to use mobile as remote after the initial update the viewing angles are ok but this is va panel so nothing like ips panel oneplus has done good job with regards to video quality as it gives dci p color gamut google assistant works fine too the best thing is the customer service oneplus offers which is top notch and they listen to you with patience after sales matter and customer service matter alot in this era overall worthy contender bought during first sale on th july this tv is a blot on the name of one plus they shouldn t have launched any product with such poor quality picture quality is very poor colors doesn t look natural at all tried all the color settings may be good for a monitor but not definitely good as a tv sound quality is the biggest setback it sounds like a rd rate speaker and sound isn t balanced there is no clarity in the sound you won t be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen frame of tv isn t durable it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute summary don t expect anything good from this tv this product doesn t deserve the one plus brand name one plus should recall this product to maintain their brand image i would have returned this product if there was an option oneplus is settled for this cheap built quality it comes with plastic body screen is not at all good if you pressure you can see liquid like flowing which we see in cheap quality products sound is too worst in an olden days when you full the volume you can get bad sound with disturbance now you can experience same with this tv ordered on th and got it by th afternoon here s an honest review but before that here s a few tips for people who are going to buy it you ll get an echo dot only if you order it with the tv at the same time read the terms and conditions before leaving one star reviews because you didn t order the echo dot from your end and obviously didn t get it with the tv to use the one plus connect app you have to update the tv first the ota will be there when you turn on the tv for the first time after that open the connect server app on the tv and then open the connect app on the phone and it would work again do a little research before leaving negative reviews and confusing the potential buyers the type sync function use the phone to type on the tv through the connect app doesn t work as of now but would start working in the next app update head over to the community forum for the one plus tv to find more details if you talk about hardware the tv is flawless those who are complaining about the tv simply have a bigger room that the tv is designed for you can always buy a soundbar if you think the volume isn t sufficient for your room for me it s more than enough the display is top notch and the colors are vibrant it s truly bezel less and looks beautiful about the software there are a few misses here and there but i m sure it can be fixed through a software update screencast lags a lot i m waiting for an update to see if it s fixed to people who think that the tv lags a lot think of the tv as a phone with gb ram if you keep opening apps repeatedly in a short period of time the phone would lag same is the case with the tv it s a value for money for those who don t wanna spend a fortune to get a tv with a good display firstly i did not receive my amazon echo dot at no cost as promised so i m really pissed off however i liked the tv good in quality and sound is pretty loud too it s absolutely slim and sleek beautifully designed kudos to designed team easy to browse through apps and quick and easy to connect to phone especially one plus phones screen cast is just a click away gotta do some more research on one connect app it s giving me some hard time to connect to the tv i bought this tv in the first sale on th july and have been loving it amazon installation was prompt and it was set up the same day as the delivery it is pretty light and slim as given in the specs the picture quality is fabulous colors are right and everything about the display is better than normal as a normal user you wouldn t notice any point of complaint regards to display speakers are loud enough and we are bound to mostly use it at of the maximum volume dolby surrounds sound is an added benefit that does enhance the sound experience of the tv it runs android out of the box with oxygen play as the skin and the ui is pretty simple it automatically fetches major information from the apps that you add to the home screen given you have signed in if required the animations and transitions between application is sleek and there is no lag whatsoever if you have used an android phone the ui is no alien and the navigation will seem very familiar the connectivity ports provided are ample and the wifi reception is also pretty strong i don t know about the bells and whistles that other tvs come equipped with but as a normal user who wants to enjoy his shows videos and cinema on a smart tv from all the contemporary sources like prime video netflix youtube etc this is the perfect option it just got delivered on the second day of sale fixed also installation was done above feet sound quality is not good remote is not actual bluetooth as it doesn t sense with this price range we could have gone with the other brands only buy if you are lover other wise its not worth overall analysis and reviews for all prospective buyers picture quality the tv is definitely a worthy purchase as its picture quality is by far the best in class in compared to other competitors build quality too is good the bezel and screen is definitely a masterpiece as the bezels are indeed minimum the way the screen is built is extremely unique and different than other competitors can t comment on viewing angles as honestly i am not an expert also most people watch tv directly in straight direction and all these viewing angles talk is just a gimmick to confuse you all osearlier reports were that the tv is very laggy especially w r t inch however i did not experience much lag one needs to understand that in this segment all competitors offer similar config of ram and processor which are definitely not high end however like how it has been hyped on lag part i found it to be rather untrue as lag exists but not to a huge extent oneplus own software optimization is amazing as really clean and bloat free the tv remembers the last input and so turns on by default on the said input mode on boot up tv has a unique style of boot up and shut down method as on single power off press it seems tv is more on standby mode and only on long press of power off will the tv shutdown completely boot up timing is good as its not too delayed sound major let down as sound is definitely not at all upto the mark however this is problem which is common amongst all competitors as each hv low quality speakers only i already have a soundbar so this aspect anywhich ways had impact as all competitors fail in sound aspect in these cost segment of tvs totally per my experience accessibility of ports perhaps the major let down for me are the accesibility of the ports as they are not at all user friendly and not readily accessible specially for people who have opted for wall mount like in my case the downward location of port is the most negative aspect for me however as i hardly use ports much so again not a major impact however for others it can seem to be a problem mainly for users who have more requirements of port like hdmi and all however with an hdmi extender you will be good to go just an investment of rs for an extender may be required table top installation people have nothing to be worried off this is least concern for them connectivity though a single band wifi router exists the same works absolutely fine and loss or issues atleast till now installation installation was a bit challenge mainly due to screw up by third party responsible for installation however with amazon escalation it was handled timely and despite hiccups tv was installed on the scheduled date only by eod there s a lot of confusion with regards to wall mount well let me be clear that wall mount is totally free and nothing needs to be paid at all beware that installation guy may make some charge and ask to pay however fight back escalate talk to their manager or ask for official bill and you will be good to go as nothing will be charged then only lack of clarity remains is around the type of wall mount used as in my case the guy used an generic brand wall mount bracket and it is not at all clear whether oneplus has their own branding of wall mount maybe others can add on remote remote design and all is pure beauty with minimalistic design however dont know where the issue seems to be with remote or otherwise as it could be like at times mutilple times pressing could be required especially to turn on the tv not sure whether its remote lag or otherwise maybe oneplus can fine tune with update overall analysis recommendation tv is definitely highly recommend for people priority and focus is picture quality and os highly recommended for ott users like me bedroom tv best choice if you have soundbar then don t think otherwise as its the best option from others outhere literally mi tv and all completely fail in comparison to this got free echo dot too many complained of not getting as they did not read the offer properly as the speaker needs to be added in cart along with tv inorder for promo to apply automatically tv is not alexa based and so could not completely reap the benefits of the same with echo however maybe with update this could be sorted too also for ott users like me it should have an option that on boot up tv starts at google launcher page only again update can take care of this a word of advice for all confused buyer s read my above detailed guide and then take a call nevertheless you won t be regretted at all with this tv oneplus has definitely delivered its premiumness with this tv for sure and which is highly visible too will update the reviews if add on or change of facts what more are you looking out for simply buy this tv never settle no audio out for the tv never tust a new brand on an entry level if picture quality is your only pripority then go for it because that sound is worst as hell i don t consider price point because is not a small amount for many people i planned to connect it to a external speaker but the port is missing no digital audio out nor the traditional mm out highly disappointed in audio category absolute disaster echo dot was free along with the product but i got to know that it needs to be added while ordering but when something is free with order why it is required to be added simply to fool people very disappointed with amazon this time really really bad there is a blue flash which appears while the tv is on repeatedly sound is the worst you can think of overall a bad decision both oneplus and amazon have been disappointing very nice tv in this price range from one plus picture quality is superb sound quality is ok ok but better than mi tv sbuilt quality is also goodtv looks premium because of bezel less design remote controller is also made of good quality plastic and it is very good looking hotkeys are provided for netflix prime video youtube and google assistant overall it s very good and budget tv from brand like one plus compared to mi realme vu thomsan etc looks great colours are amazing however user experience is not refined at all for oneplus standard and even for any other standards for that matter will edit the review once oneplus fixes below issues below are some of the bugs i observed in the last days needs immediate attention from op software team to protect op s reputation very laggy interface across all apps including home screen play store voice assistant netflix etc when the tv is off power button had to be pressed couple of times before the tv could turn on when the tv is off bluetooth keeps connecting back and disconnecting from tv alexa keep saying got connected to oneplus tv every few mins when used as a external speaker even when tv is off tv also takes time to register inputs from op connect app no keyboard on op connect app after restart again need to open connect app on tv for op connect app on mobile to detect op tv customize channels on the homescreen keeps getting reset even when no input is connected to the tv the tv boots to one of the inputs hdmi channel scan instead of home screen menu button hardly has any use on home screen and only works when used with external inputs there is no option to adjust colours sound in realtime with hardware remote i e while watching media on tv alexa app does not recognize the tv even after adding and linking account in oneplus tv skilli guess can t be fixed with software but still want to capture for records while watching from straight gives great picture quality in the class viewing angles are pretty bad compared to competition got this tv as a cheap and small entertainment unit for my bedroom below are the quick pointers pros overall design is very sleek with almost non existent bezels on three sides back mount is available along with two plastic feets that hold the tv up nice and firmly however you install it enough connectivity options incl hdmi arc optical spdif and they work as intended standard smart remote with netflix prime youtube and google assistant buttons please note that you have to pair the remote with the tv for the first time before you can use the bluetooth mode search in web the display is pretty good with excellent color accuracy though there s no hdr dolby vision support however i ve seen the hdr implementation in cheap tvs and i d rather have overall bright and uniform screen which this tv provides minimum backlight bleeding slight loss of brightness at high angles of viewing but pq remains same sound quality is pretty average but loud it s good enough for a room but at more than volume the dialogues become difficult to understand i ve heard the speakers in other sub k sets and this one is definitely among the top inbuilt android os is pretty good have access to almost all the entertainment apps that work out of the box there s a bit of lag at times when switching apps and scrolling the menu but it s not too distracting works great with google home and offers full voice control inbuilt chromecast is fast and connects quickly you can also cast video from laptop using chrome vlc other cast apps cons only p though youtube will go to full hd given the price point it s fair but a full hd panel would ve been worth more to both consumers and company at close distance you can see the leds but more than ft you re game no ghz wifi band support but that s alright because sub hd content will not need more than mbps at max channel congestion can be a problem if you have too many devices connected to the ghz band so keep that in mind remote lags a bit post cold startup especially in apps like hotstar maybe software update will fix this is the worst product by oneplus i ordered this bcoz i m a big fan of oneplus smartphones and used every smartphone of oneplus so i thought this led will also be amazing but as i received the product speakers were not working no wifi connection was enabled so the guy who visited to install this marked as defected again when i received the replacement now the display was not working properly so i returned this only the good thing is the delivery by amazon which is very fast worst ever product from oneplus remote not working properly whenever i m trying to switch on the tv using the remote it never responds even oneplus care didn t provide any solution for this issue amazon provided a replacement but the problem still

after that no response from amazon i called oneplus care about that problem times also oneplus told me u can contact to amazon we can t do anything from here amazon will help you after that i felt upset i think no one help after sell then i decided i will cancel that tv then i cancelled so don t buy one plus tv also tv ratings not good overall rating so please go for vu cinema tv best tv under also samsung motorola u can go for these tv s based on a real incident at first remote s down arrow button was not working i was so not in a good mood i hit the remote with my hand just like all indians do it started working the media could not be loaded no doubt tv is value for money but has few small issues it doesn t gets on with single press of power button on remote it is a bit slow because of gb ram sound quality is not a expected few people mentioned about not receiving free echo dot i got it for free just you need to add it to cart with tv and at checkout they will give a full discount for echo dot display quality is top notch even though it s fhd and for the sound quality i also had issue with it but first go in sound setting and turn on surround sound and dolby sound and then feel the real sound this tv can provide earlier i had an issue with tv not being able to turn on by remote but after reading the manual i cane to know that to turn on tv it uses ir blaster on remote like old days unlike bluetooth so u have to point it directly to the right bottom of the tv a splendid purchase for the price really happy and the display is really punchy and colour accurate again good quality product deliver by oneplus i m using mi tv past years with lot of lagging while app to launcher switch this tv has no problem faced still now remote working smoothly picture quality good if u switch dolby digital plus the sound quality of tv speakers is good also i connect ant sound bar to tv is amazing not great in mi tv after update oneplus connect and chromecast working awesome tv valuable your money u wont regret did a mistake of pre ordering it without even waiting for the review the picture quality is not that great the interface has too much lags audio quality is also not upto the mark but has some of the coolest features cannot complaint for k but expected a bit more improved product from oneplus i mean that s what they are known for their speed and it certainly lacks in this tv wast of money it s not a good tvsub standard product picture was just ok very slow interface sound is very awful if you look for a good tv pls only buy prominent brands tv very much disappointed with this purchase writing after a months review bought this tv as just to test amazing powerful small tv inch with nice picture quality it does what it says most importantly it works amazing with amazon prime hotstar etc many tvs in this segment claim to be smart but fail to perform surprisingly tv tv is indeed a powerhouse which works without any lag amazing work by oneplus with just gb ram honestly speaking no tv can offer what this tv is offering in this price range i have nothing to complain about this tv when picture move fast then this tv not handel picture quality this tv sell without basic testing on news channel button of tv news headline moving not handel blur brightness feel your eye bad investment or k more and buy lg tv honest review after using for days i received the tv on the date mentioned inspite of the travel restrictions as my address was listed in a containment zone good job by the amazon delivery in kollam kerala the product is really worth the money you spend all features mentioned work you just have to update it first picture quality is excellent chromecast screencast works fine oneplus connect works you have to follow the instructions in the app all apps are working fine hotstar youtube amazon prime netflix you can connect the echo dot to this television and it works perfectly fine sound quality is more than average compared to the negative reviews that have been mentioned it is more than enough for the television it will depend vary on the platform you are using to view the videos the wall mount was installed by the service staff and they came at the correct time as agreed overalli am more than happy with the product i was a bit skeptical about the product after ready all the negative reviews but i have received a good product and it meets all the specifications mentioned by oneplus great job by oneplus in coming up with a budget tv when i purchased this tv there is a offer of eco dot is free with it but they do legal fraud with customers which we can t do any think even when i said to customer center for writing complaint but they said we can t write complaint bcz we didn t violet terms and conditions it s really bad from amazon india but about one plus tv picture quality is much better sound is ok ok over all tv is good with this price range average picture qualitybelow average sound qualitysometimes

product tv and amazon home service provided to me not recommended tv is overall better than others at this price this is the best picture quality is fabulous apps work fine only it lags a bit don t use it for gaming only for viewing tv great product again from oneplus picture quality is superb screen size and picture ratio is best in this range sound quality is ok when u compare it with vu cinema which have w speakers but all in all nice tv in this range from oneplus it could not even run for days and now i am not getting a refund replacement update after using for more than a month very late response and also laggy device kindly think before buying this one i have oneplus mobile still doesn t work hassle free it s too slow remote response is almos second late no wall mount was provided by the oneplus nor was available with the installation team had to use my old wall mount all over happy pls mention for wall mount additional charges if required before the installation guy comes display quality is excellentsound is okconnectivity with ott apps are little bit slowno screen mirror option only chrome cast but you can do the job with an additional device via hdmi portfinally to say worth for price in this segmenttv installation service become a bit challenge in my area quite satisfied with the product for the price range for people complainting about lag issue its nothing to do with ram ir storage just pair the remote with bluetooth by default remote works with ir which needs a straight line of sight once you pair it as bluetooth it works like a charm to pair the remote with bluetooth just go to setting in tv and click on remote and accessories adter that click left and home key simultaneously on remote it will be paired and no lag issue will be there the media could not be loaded loving the picture quality and the thin bezels wasn t expecting great sound from the reviews but am surprisingly satisfied from the output for my room all the os features working after the update oneplus connect was not that useful till now the remote is nice the packaging was simple and easy to unpack as mentioned in the description the packaging includes tv remote user manual warranty included aaa battery wall mount is not included the tv is very slim light weighted and easy to setup display looks good sound is fine operating the tv is easy too audio stopped working after days and one plus is not supporting and asking to contact amazon not sure who will help with this one of problems buying online products full hd p video picture good sometimes remote is not responding well sound could ve been better new app install update uninstall are very easy also have some pre installed app which is not uninstallable overall good tv better than mi this product is very good and excellent sound quality don go with the negative review this product is just awesomethe review in youtube and other social media platforms are totally wrong i personally used this tv i got y last wednesday itself came in good package no issues with amazon or oneplus packages picture and sound is dope even it connected easily with my lan and phone the tv is good for the price you pay we things that i would like to suggest bring it to notice this not yet compatible with alexa sound output is average would recommend a sound bar to enhance sound quality try blaunpaunkt sb picture quality is good few backlight bleeds you will need to set it to correct color setting to have a good viewing experiencerest is good hoping oneplus would give ota updates to resolve few things it s disappointing to see that sound was not something one plus put their efforts to improve fortunately i didn t get a laggy tv mine works fine although power on and off with the remote is tricky and build quality is the lowest i expected there are haps everywhere very low quality body have to be very fragile while moving it although having these problems i don t think i will return the product but still to play a game with a brand image of one plus it really did some damage this time i won t recommend this if you are saving up for an immersive experience it lacks some of the basics of tv requirment great deal although little bit disappointed for speaker but in this price range its worth ittips buy prime membership before buying this tv its worth it the first time i m writing against one plus the way one plus brand its image is great but when it comes to television section it s worst it s just days y series w inches tv has gone wrong with its technical issues where the wifi is not getting connected smart tv without wifi connectivity is as waste as it is after raising complaint to one plus tv days back yet no one responded i suggest everyone s go ahead with mi better price best quality as my cousin uses it from one long year amazon was best at service recently even it turned out to be worst after delivery of defect product still amazon wabt back up and make customer feel terrible on service as returns the product amazon dosent have option to retun money abd they won t pace up in service too post collection of tv amazon tele representative says it will take days to get deliver new one i dint understand why i ve to wait after paying k and getting defective amazon tele representative says be patience cos of this guy s service it s creating mental agony worst service from amazon and worst product from one plus two big brands loosing their image great picture quality good sound lacks the bass effect but dolby audio enhances the sound best tv in the price segment don t think twice just go for it product is made in india picture quality super sound super connectivity super no buffering prime or netflix or youtube feels like theatre experiencewon t work proper with oneplus phone to oneplus tv lags too muchworth buying picture quality is best with super colorssound is not upto the mark tried bass but it s ok for w also tried surround sound it s ok checked screen cast lil bit of delay in it hope you find this helpful excellent features and working also perfect best tv on budget simply buy it i got this tv on th sept after days both the hdmi ports stopped working i have initiated the warranty claim by amazon three times but it has been days and no one came to repair the tv worst service by amazon i am a prime customer but now i regret talking to a lot of people and asking them to visit amazon to give honest reviews on all the products there is a lot going behind the bars now and quality has reduced drastically best tv at this price available in market no complaints about it every thing is good and fantastic only thing is you need oneplus or apple device to connect to oxygen play but you can also access it on the tv so no issues the media could not be loaded everything is just perfect except sound quality bass lovers should buy soundbar to experience this amazing product best pricegood picturegood screeni hate soundsspeaker not goodtemple speaker thu simple and nice tv with loads of features in small budget happy with the quality and performance thank you amazon and one plus for delivering the best beast tv everything is just amazing only oneplus connect is useless but it s ok when you have normal remote you really don t need that stupid application please go ahead and buy it you can trust amazon and the installation company to help you during any ups and down they are really helpful installation is free and wallmount is also free you don t have to pay rupee also if you don t ask them to put new switch board or wiring or something they will come drill holes and put the mount and will go simple and easy the media could not be loaded bought this product on october tv was quite impressive in the beginning and picture quality was also good on april tv screen got black sounds are coming but no visual technician told panel issue it s been months but my tv problem is not yet resolved let s see whether tv will be repaired or not under warranty duration i hope amazon will help me out asap oneplus amazon qdigii will update my feedback guys about warranty promises shared by oneplus group whether it is real or painful i hope i will not lose my trust from oneplus brand they will sort this out and help me too thanksabhishek got defective pc the same has been informed the tv installer dead pixel and damaged on bezel don t purchase this after using couple of weeks i am writing this review my opiniononeplus tv is similar in to mi tv vu tv realme tv motorola tv in terms of functions and performance there is no brand mark on the tv i am neither happy nor sad don t wait for the flash sale go for any tv all are same didnt expect from oneplus bad sound quality lags aftr days appers lines on tv i cant return tv bcoz return period is over very worst build please dont buy remote conectivity is slow and sound clarity is some less rather than tv is amazing super extraordinary tv nice in budget too slow with lag due to less ram did not expected this from oneplus avoid buying this one overall it s a good tv for the price i got the tv echo dot and years of warranty i did find it a bit laggg initially but seemed better after the first update the wall mount took an additional like this tv very much better picture quality good sound and connection floor stand distance is high so couldn t accommodate in my small tv table sometimes prime get restart automatically otherwise it s a pakka product thumbs up for timely delivery and installation for amazon review after days picture quality is good and for the price is great as got rs echo dot and years extended warranty it s looking very good till now however i installed it on my own installation is pretty late by delivery tv is looking great physically and also its interface easy to useonly one problem i am facing that is connecting the tv to the settop box through hdmi port always mute the audio after power on but hdmi arc port is working fine also i cannot control the volume of the tv in the settop box using settop box remote on dolby mode i purchased this only for the brand name you get a woww factor when you say you have one plus tv other than that it is pretty normal tv for this price range you get cheaper k tv from thompson mi and vu for this price range so you are actually paying k for this brand value and nothing else as the specs and performance match with other tv brands display quality is very good and sound could have been better these are on par with other tv on this same price range down firing speakers make sound little muffled casting works perfectly in both android and iphone airtel xrteam or jio live tv app is not available for any tv models but you can run it on phone and cast it to tv so you don t have to purchase a dth or cable with smart tv with built in chromecast tv does become slow when you open multiple apps but this is problem in all budget tv models hdmi ports is not a problem at all as mostly you would only use ports for dth and for playstation since moving to ott we no more use dvd or blue ray players also chromecast is inbuilt so there is really no need for rd hdmi cable nice productpicture quality is awesomein budget of k it s good to buy and u get echo dot freeand if u purchase the extra waranty it is free with itif u don t add echo dot while purchasing then u will not recieve with tv u have to add to cart during purchasing with tv then checkout for paymentscreen cast is laggy sound quality is ok great product at after card discount amazing panel and color depth go for it wont regret the media could not be loaded nice quality picture quality is value for money is sheerness is all over oneplus connect app feature is good remote is outstanding sometimes menu app is not work google assistant is only work perfectly on youtube not work properly in full led perfectly view from m away sound surrounding media album feature only available for oneplus phone user screenshot feature is also outstanding all over good for experience android tv of oneplus y awesome product returning tv do not think to buy a very bad product from oneplus find following flaws after using tv for a couple of days tv getting hang quite often very slow processor remote is slow sometimes command do not reach the tv very bad build quality cheap material used no buttons in tv set apart from power bluetooth does not works properly oneplus and amazon technical team dont have knowledge about the product bluetooth speaker headphone do not connect automatically it require to unpair everytime to re connect sound quality not upto thr mark not expected this from oneplus tv is very good at this price installation was not done by the service provider as promised by amazon eco dot was not provided along with the tv this was not accepted from oneplus i bought this tv on it s first sale picture quality is like lcd tv not like led tv sound quality is not comfortable to ear need more concentration to hear sound to understand the words design design is goodremote remote is also goodneed an update to fix this issue but if it is a lcd tv then no update can fix the picture quality of this tv hope for the best this is fantastic tv ever please do not trust any bad review i personally loving it there is not any lag issue very slim and best tv under k the media could not be loaded i am a oneplus user since never expected these sort of cheap quality product from oneplus tv stopped working after months display is blank now oneplus service is pathetic they are not responding even weeks after raising the complaint don t waste money on this crap expected a lot but basic things not functioning the jio g connection doesn t get listed and hence cannot be selected the connect app doesn t connect though chromecast is available i have been unable to cast anything sound is not smooth remote sensitivity is very low when compare to mi tv its ver hard for me to change the channel had an extremely poor experience with oneplus tv tv screen turns black on random occasions but frequently it again turns back on in sec to min sounds stops working similarly picture turns green randomly this doesn t feel like a oneplus product even local brands provide better products after all this i applied for replacement and then amazon scheduled an inspection service and the inspection guy didn t show up had to rescheduled it two more times but no one shows up contacted amazon and told the whole scenario then they replaced it directly got the replaced product but the issues are still there and this time the product feels like second hand only that this time the issues ka worse and more frequent that last one filed a return request again got inpection service scheduled and after explaining previous experience to customer care this time got a call from inspection guy he made a video of the issue he said that he has verified the issue but i did not receive any response from amazon regarding this and the worse thing amazon is not providing customer care support now tried multiple times but didn t recieve any call from amazon feeling stuck with this defective product won t be using amazon for a long time now update after initiating the return order again amazon sent people for picking up the defective item now waiting for refund initiation excellent picture quality best primium look the media could not be loaded i m one oneplus fan always tv in this low bedget is very good sound quality need improvement picture quality is good and over all value for money good product worth buying at this price point picture quality is awesome sound is good but no bass bezzle less design is good worth buying at this price the media could not be loaded it s awesome tv at k except for viewing angles it s color production and lookwise it s unmatchable from front on it matches any full hd tv interface is smooth color production is really good blacks are really black like oled panelfrom sides it s colors fade is noticable it s the only but big negative from onepluswhen it comes to sound it is good while streaming through apps like youtube hotstar with set of box it s bit low no lag in os remote is easy to operate and premium look after months usage it s going great and really satisfiedafter almost year usage i m satisfied with this tv picture quality is of high class one issue noticeable is there is a mm gap at the base frame not a major concern but oneplus need to take care if you are using it only with set of box use a good hdmi cable it will really enhances viewing experience with av cables you will get very poor picture quality it s one year of moderate use but i m getting back light issues on screen currently it s not a issue while watching but if it continues to intensity it will be a issue i didn t expect that within a year awesome picture quality sound settings is little bit tricky otherwise you will get low quality audio output no lagging found while using apps with echo dot i think it s a good deal picture quality is very good compare to others tv in this budgetsound is extremely goodpremium lookmust buy this tv in this budget excellent picture quality value for money oneplus case id j zmestf tpq we purchased oneplus tv in july tv had issues with sound quality but picture quality is fine after months of use suddenly display become dark in may and no visual we had complained the issue in one plus customer care literelly you need to wait for min after weeks engineer arrived home in june after screening he confirmed that display need to be replace he ordered for part in june till now we have made s of calls to customer care twitter handle this guy s really robots asking same information again n again but no one turned on litterelly we are in home without tv bloody oneplus post sales i would strongly suggest you not to buy oneplus tvs better go with old brands just belive me otherwise you will be in soup oneplus case reference id j zmestf tpq don t buy this tv i am really disappointed not worthable bezel less display worthy of money dedicated tv os week use reviewpros picture quality good you need to try different mode like for watching movie try movie mode for sports use sports mode bezel are really very less at this price truely smart download one plus connect and use your mobile as a mobile first update the tv s software after that no slowness in software you can cast mobile screen with this amazing software one plus connect no issues in casting from youtube amazon even gaana to play songs remote is what it should be like all necessary keys no useless keys conssound could be little better but it is still better than my old sony bravia rest all is good awesome sounds connectivity picture quality in this price love it thanks amazon oneplus very nice quality overall best tv to buy under k very nice picture and sound quality sometimes flicker if redmi cable is close but the installation service is very bad the media could not be loaded respected viewer i know before purchasing this expensive leisure you will be viewing the rewievs let me tell you this tv has a great picture quality and smart features but this crashed in just days of use i purchased this tv long time back and it was kept in one corner of my house and then after a hell lot of scams one fine day a totally unprofessional fellow came to install it after damaging the whole wall with innumerable drills he installed it and didn t even explain the features which somehow we got to know about then he charged the double price for the wall mount then after thousands of complaints finally we got a refund would suggest to buy from a showroom hope you find it helpful but informally would like to tell if you don t want to fall in any sort of problem then please don t purchase this product have a good day wonderful picture quality easy to operate but one plus connect app doesn t work volume is not that much but it s worth it for the price it comes under price is reasonable picture quality is good connectivity also good remote is small and good sound is ok need to explore more bazzle is almost negligible looks good in this price you can t ask for more awesome picture quality a bit slow operating system else everything is good just amazing best in the segmentno competition with thisgreat colors and bezel less display amazing oneplus tv is best but amazon courier faciliti is very very bad i am very irritating for wating this product for this much price we can say tv is good in every aspect but there is a lagging problem it s taking time to open any app i am not too happy with this one i had huge expectations too much of led bleeding issues and patches across the panel i am awaiting an inspection from amazon so hoping for a replacement soon initial overview price wise a good deal if my panel issue gets resolved but if you don t consider the price this comes nowhere near to a samsung panel the most horrible thing about this tv is its remote control very much irritating you to press the button times to change something not expected this from one plus although this tv has a good picture quality average sound clarity and a decent bezel less display it can be said a value for money product but the remote connectivity and performance is awful waiting since last year for in tv finally able to purchase more value for less money happy with product value for money screen is bit delicate except tht everything is fine awesome design so far so good if you re going to purchase this product make sure you have atleast gb day data plan dedicated to this tv also you need a wifi router for getting full functionality let me start with the pros picture quality is great you ll need some tweeks though set it on movie preset for day time use energy saving for night time use i reduced backlight to and it s in user mode to reduce eye strain audio quality is good you also need a lot of tweeks though set it in movie preset if you re watching movies this preset let s you hear all the music details also you ll hear the dialogues crystal clear in this mode you won t hear bass that much you ll get a hint of base nothing much because base will affect the dialogues set it in music preset if you re listening to music in this preset you ll hear all the highs and lows crystal clear you ll get bass as well okay now discuss about the conseverything else in this tv is a con it has data saver installed but you can t able to access it data savers has an update in playstore for some reason it s not updating you can t use this tv as a bluetooth speaker you have to cast your phone screen in order to play your music on tv screen which brings a lot of problems first you need a wifi router with gb data dedicated to this tv for casting only because it s using chromecast not miracast so what happens is you are sharing your mobile screen to your tv using mobile data even though it s on same network which is stupid why in the world i have to spend my data to transfer the data packets using my router it s on same network for god s sake also while casting if you open youtube in your phone it opens youtube app on tv so you ll end up spending x data for playing youtube video for playing in mobile for transferring data to tv and for the video playing on tv but fellow competitors like mi tv also have built in chromecast only i don t know any budget tv which supports miracast if you knew comment below to let me know it can only access hard disc upto tb some apps like udemy are not supported on this tv you re going to spend more money on ott let me explain how if you re going to use netflix on tv you ll need premium subscription to add devices at a time also if you have airtel xstreme on your phone and thinking i can use airtel xstreme on tv you re wrong you need to purchase xstreme for tv as well if you re rich enough to purchase all ott platforms and have enough money to spend gb day data on tv on regular basis you ll love this tv otherwise you re gonna end up hating this tv and yourself for purchasing this tv i chose to purchase this tv because it s an android tv also home services during warranty period is free i don t have to take this tv to the service centre if there s something s wrong after warranty period they charge for the service which is cheaper than other brand but if i knew i m gonna get this for k i wouldn t even think about purchasing this tv because i got these picture and audio in my old sansui lcd tv which lasted years without any issues excellent tv picture quality superb for sounds i will give for connectivity overall excellent tv in low budget better than others brands outstanding i love it nuch better then mi led good in this price awesome product superb audio n video really experienced with k video n dolby audio but google chrome not installed in this after using y for monthbought this oneplus y android tv for a very cheap price but the product isn t upto oneplus standards the picture quality is ok and sometimes it gets flaky and dark for no reasons once i fiddle around with the picture settings this issue fixes but it happens frequently it s like the tv is unable to remember the picture settings sound quality is also just about ok there s like literally no bass doesn t matter how many different audio settings you try the audio is weak but you could say itna paisa me itna ich milega important issues the tv hangs it just freezes not very much but once in every days then you have to restart it from the main switch many times there s no audio doesn t matter which input you try to fix this i have to restart the tv from the main switch i sometimes connect bluetooth headphones to my tv to connect it the first time obviously pairing is required but to connect it the second time i have to unpair my headphones and then again pair it otherwise the headphones won t connect automatically and there s no option to search manually for previously connected devices every time i have to unpair and then pair the bluetooth device the tv remote hangs too not all the times mostly it works very smooth but sometimes it hangs i think this issue is because sometimes the remote doesn t get connected to tv via bluetooth not to forget the tv doesn t have a mm jack you cannot access tv settings while you are using any app you will have to close the app and go to home screen to change audio video settings etc netflix only works in hd quality there s no fhd support for netflix i use k netflix subscription but on this tv it only works in hd the alexa support is still not available in the tv i just cannot connect my amazon echo device to the tv tried everything every steps i could find on the internet over several forums at the end a oneplus official answered my query on one of oneplus official forums that the alexa support will be made through an app which will be released shortly the app isn t released till date overall i five stars to the tv just because of price and remote design there s nothing else special about the tv disappointed with oneplus purchased oneplus inch tv stopped working within a month even after complaining several time there is no response edit screen was replaced after month of complaint in januarysoon after few weeks again the same issue has been started now i make a complaint lets see when i will get a replacement this is a review post two months of usage the tv on the hardware front is really good but the software in the tv is really sad there is a lot of time lag when you are casting to the tv sound goes immediately but the video lags by more than seconds the tv also keeps giving out a google assistant error message randomly there were times when the audio error message was made in the middle of the night when the tv was switched off unless the software is upgraded or rectified i wouldn t recommend this tv this review is coming from a person who is was a diehard fan of oneplus i have mobile phones from op in my home plz improve courier speedpicture quality was best and nice biuld qualitybluetooth was not stableremote was some times delay power on the tv time and some more improve tv quality and more nothing better than this in the market in this price range buy without any hesitation like a lot of other people i didn t get the echo dot too so a little sad about that but tv is amazing oneplus connect app was good picture quality and sound quality are more than expected oneplus wont let you regret buying this quality producthappy buying and happy watching i have done lot of research before purchase on the basis of review and youtube videos but does not helped in making any derision rather i was confused between all chinese brand then made a purchase for rs including hdfc card discount watched hd videos with pmy opinion is belowbuy this tv if your budget is strictly constraint to k you do not bother about picture quality don t buy if you are used to watch samsung sony tv full hd videos in mobile or have a full hd monitor its quality does not matches samsung smart tv that is available for rs returned tv back to amazon now looking to buy a samsung one dont believe any false review and go for it it is the best tv at this price you cannot expect anything more at this price the product delivered on th july installation schedule on th july delayed process in installation picture quality is ok sound quality is good for small room strong internet connection need for better performance otherwise this tv is lagging i face connectivity issues mobile phone is not connected easily i have connected internet through mobile hot spot connetivity some time i face hanging problem which i have power of once remote is not working properly i am very disappointed when my pendrive is not connected i never expected this issue in oneplus brand i replaced this tv immediately after my installation process in this price segment this tv is good washed off picture quality as pixel density is less sound is okay but dolby features are gimmick should have been a p display no installation wall mount bracket with tv need to purchase it seperately it s a made in india product and plastics sockets and fit n finish is not as good as its chinese counterparts like mi vu and others worst installation service after days still no installation hence canceled the tv mi tv offers better package for less rs and better build quality i booked repair service by oneplus care app no one come and update the status too many time tried to contacting customer care of oneplus no acknowledgment and tried booked by amazon warranty services no one come on appointment date they reschedule the appointment without contact me this is very bad service bhai log this is suvi from nagpur maharashtra bro tv is all good no lags no nothing very good picture quality good sound and worth buying it if you are buying it for home use purposes all those glitches and lags are just because of wifi speed in order to use this tv at high speed u must have high speed internet available or else for tv serial use it is all good go on with it i have used mi and one pluspros picture quality one plus is better sound quality one is bettercons lags heavily while changing ott and switch on off this too much annoying never expected this due to this sometime in the background last played will continue for few seconds it spoiled entire mood and concept of good quality tv mi is much better there is not much lag remote design absolutely poor engineering remote design it s not handy to use hold and stupid placement of keys in the remote made poor engineering design products as compared mi is far better simple sleek and to the target time to switch on takes more than usual time it s honest review not filters i purchased inch tv and having best bezeless tv experience you will find in this price range premium built video quality is simply awesome with dolby audio value for money worth it i ve got internal storage of gb and here is mentioned gb of storage can i know why i bought this tv in april and it stopped working within a month okay that s fine it can happen with any product right it took almost months to get a service guy that s also fine even though i had no entertainment at home because of the lockdown going on everywhere all of sudden a service guy came like an angel and said i have to pay for the service as the board is burned it won t comes under their warranty policy great i have been using a vu tv for the past years that too got damaged but replaced with a brand new tv twice without even any questions asked it was my great mistake i thought oneplus would provide quality products and quality services they just su k the tv is an okay ish buy don t come for the brand here i would happily suggest anyone to go with a samsung or even onida tv which does come at a nearby price point the sound is low but what to expect from a watt internal speaker even though it is back lit with led there are certain points where you will not be able to see anything it will be pitch black while it should have been normal and for the game mode i used my ps xbox one and switch along with that played a couple of matches in battlefield and wwii it reduces lag but not upto a gaming level the remote cannot start the tv all the time it is slow when it comes to remote response but that is only for the start up but at this price point what can one expect and at the time of writing this review i had a serious issue a few days back but the inputs from hdmi produced a grayscale output i thought the tv was done for but it happens across all the oneplus tv s it seems if anyone has the same issue reset the entire tv i wasted some time with amazon and oneplus care by scheduling repair services but it was no good all in all i love one plus despite the negative points stated the above has stars for amazon and for the tv if you want to try this one gladly you are welcome but i would suggest you to try another brand specifically well established ones like samsung or sony or tcl or onida picture quality not that much better but ok sound quality is good gud display audio output superb oneplus tv arrived my home todayit very slim and price was also good it was very slim and easy to handle i like one plus not china the media could not be loaded i bought this tv on october for inch it s almost a year now i m writing this review even after so many negative reviews i placed order on my own risk but its worth the order tv is fine working well as displayed ignore the negative reviews guy from amazon mounted on wall wellgood sound quality video quality everything is good i m really satisfied by plus display quality is bestsound enough for a medium sized hallscreen mirroring works without laggingconsgoogle voice search delays by seconds plus connect isn t so much interesting as it s too much slowbluetooth we can t connect our mobile but only tv with headset and bluetooth speakerso don t think of connecting mobile bluetoothoveralldisplay is awesomesound quality nicebass average i order the product on th july flash sale it is worth for this price and good picture and sound quality picture quality is amazing i have been using the inch y series for over a week now pros love the black tones the tv itself is very aesthetic latest android loaded all frequently used apps programs available in the tv the remote is very sleek and is bluetooth enabled no need to point remote to tv the delivery and installation services were very quick and efficient cons the os laga the build quality does not feel great plastic body doesn t work well with alexa sound quality is not great the colours are not great either does not have different picture colour modes the biggest con for me is that it does not have adaptive display and gets too bright in low light while in standard settings overall for the price of k k the tv is totally worth buying remember that this is a budget tv premium tv s are almost double the cost value for money got it delivered on exact date and installation done next day loved the product better then mi and realme i guess the media could not be loaded alright here is the new one plus tv y you can watch unboxing on my you tube channel x plorer i have been using this tv since a week now here are some pros and cons of the tv pros price yes being a indian we always seek products which are best quality with affordable price it fits well gift yes you get alexa dot with oneplus y and u tvs who don t like free stuff picture quality is super with baseless design of of total view viewing angel will give you great experience build quality i have been trying different tvs till now including mi inch iffalcon inch and other but trust me this one plus is far ahead when it comes to design and quality material cons sound yes it has wt output sound with dolby atmos but you won t feel bass ram it has gb ram with internal storage of gb out of which only around gb is useful this would make operation lit slow andoid oxygen play it s hardly has watchable content and it s too old as there is patch wall picture quality sound quality is up to mark blindly go with it i have used it for only day but my experience is awesome and i didn t felt any laggy experience with the tv everything other than installation is remarkable the tv s voice assistant features are almost non functional every time when i tried the voice command the ongoing video movie stuck the picture and sound quality are not so great for a room of sqft and there was a lot of glare even with less light in the room tried all the suggestions on changing contrast brightness etc by looking at the hype i expected a lot but this tv did not meet any of my expectations and left a disappointing experience too good purchase without hasitation only d problem is amazon late service n nothing else love it amazing picture qualitydoesn t lag only lag found was during initial setup w speaker with dolby speakers does a great jobbezels are extremely less and gives a nice experience oneplus did a great job and does give a premium feel cons audio quality should be tweaked no bass which is a huge disappointment alexa is not bundled you need to add it separately during the purchase amazon when you mention that alexa comes free with this purchase then make it bundled with the tv unit and do not ask customers to add it separately during the purchase don t expect the customers to add it separately during the flash sale this is simply cheating on the customers i don t get the original bill with box kindly provide me a softcopy of my bill sound quality is a bit poor remaining things are good delivery in time and installation was also in time overall good service apart from the screen size and the clarity and the sound ofcourse nothin in this is a good buy technically challengedevery time yo switch on the tv you need to have a separate network in which you connect it first then only you can connect it to your wifi pathetic response timeif incase you re in a bad mood then refrain from switching on this tv cuz it s going to be like solving a puzzle what went wrong what possibly can be right and after all of that the remote will give you a run which you never wanted i can go on but not worth my time just one thing if you think of buying cheap you can opt for tcl instead but these are just junk covered with a shiny plastic and a good outlook it s been days i am using this tv honestly the display quality is just amazing and the truly bezel less display looks incredible however i am disappointed with the sound quality it s doesn t sound good i think becoz the speakers are down facing but if u have a external speaker which i have thn it s not the issue another problem is that tv is not that smooth and it lags a lot of times hopefully oneplus will send will fix it with the update overall i am happy becoz sound issue is not a big deal as i use a speaker which everyone should if you want to enjoy movies on prime and netflix lagging issue will b fixed becoz i trust oneplus as thr service is really good overall it s not a bad deal seeing the amazing display and stylish looking frame remote connectivity is weak writing this feedback as the tv does not startup using one click on the remote power button i have to keep on clicking for many times till it starts up happens all time i ensured that there is no obstacle between remote and the tvsecondly i did connect sound using bluetooth device after days of use i either have to clear cache memory for bluetooth system or cut off the power completely and restart to use the sound via bluetoothoverall experience of buying this tv was really not good i would say customer support does not answer your query accurately showroom guys wants to route to customer care for anything issues i bought an another tv from mi and it has been used since last yrs i would really recommend everyone to go for mi no issues till date instead this one if you are looking for budget tv go for it regarding sound issueif you use hdmi cable you will get dolby atmos audio which is very low as sound will be disturbed evenly with surrounding but if you use the old regular analogue pin adapter probes coloroued pins for sound video used for dvd players you will get better loud sound so goodenough the conclusion is if you want huge sounds go for probes you will get so high volume even when you put tv output volume to or but if you want dolby clarity sound but less volume output go for hdmi cable it will be clear but low the picture quality is very bad even at resolution the images are very blurry and one can see lots of pixels the colors r too bright and most of the things are seen as white spots instead of light yellow or bluelooks like the are capturing and sending the data to chinese serversi have mitv and it has much better quality and color output and sound quality alsocolor seems to be over saturatedthe home screen is traditional android which is quite boring and does not gives u that rich feel same thing with remote which is quite of plastic and on press of single button it take to clicks emote very uneasy and buttons placed illogicalon poweroff tv does not switch off its just turn itself mute and screen off thus keep burning ur power even when in sleep modeno audio point to connect to home theater or external entityits gives the feel of low cost quality and audio as one gets in start hotelsavoid do not go with just name its not worth the tv stopped working after months i have registered a complaint about amazon and oneplus no one has called or came to me for servicing the product how come you close the issue by your self this is totally unexpected and unacceptable from your side it is very shameful on part of you simply bluffing the customer even after repeated complaints to the oneplus and amazon no action has been taken it is very shameful to both amazon and oneplus for their services screen casting not working the product is worth its price let me highlight certain pointspros display the display is brilliant specially the black color gamut is awesome smart features good smart features easy to download contents design bezel less design gives an appealing lookcons although the product has dolby digital surround sound but still it feels a bit low output in terms of voice the operating remote feels a lag when you switch on the t v no button features due to which the t v is solely dependent on the remote and once u get any issues with the remote you re in trouble installation its been a month since this product was delivered but still installation has not been arranged by amazon secondly the delivery guy was very rude did not deliver the product at home had to go almost a mile to receive my product my request to all please ensure your installation else you would be left in oblivion like me the almost bezel less display feels good on wall i am writing this review after using the tv for more than monthspros picture and sound quality is goodnice and handy remotecons says alexa supports this product but it only supports volume turn off tv change input hangs once or twice in a day which is very bad didn t expect this from one plus when viewed from side picture becomes more white visibility is not good from side angles when try to switch on tv you have to be within one meter for remote to work else tv will not switch on this is worst actually i went through all the comments and reviews i was initially intersted in oneplus but after reading these reviews i got confused then i checked for other smart tvs and finally settled to purchase this oneplus tv only because of the trust and experience i had on oneplus products mainly mobile phones which me and my family are using believe me after receiving this tv i couldn t understand why people are so critical about this it serves all the purpose very well all smart features are excellent connectivity is so good picture quality and sound is absolutely fine and sufficient for me people complaint about its picture sound quality but i found it amazing i don t expect any better clarity of picture than this tv and sound i couldn t use it on more than volume in my sq ft room guys it s just a tv it could be bad good or excellent for me it s excellent i am not looking for a wife here and people who are being so critical about this tv i don t know what are they were expecting may be they are comparing this tv with a pvr screen or its sound with a bose music system then definitely it s a below expectation product for you sorry for your loss value for money worst service ever it s just been days tht we bought it it was all working fine and all of a sudden it shut down and we were unable to switch it on that too no body touched it or did anything how can this happen quite surprised i d tried calling oneplus customer care they re saying they won t be able to replace it since we d purchased it from amazon and this seems to be too hectic to hear what s this amazon never expected this the quality of the service is pathetic please don t buy it from amazon for their eye catching offers it always good to go n buy from their own website i feel so if i would have done that then i would have got a replacement atleast i never expected from oneplus tv experience is with pictures quality and sound along with smart features picture quality very poor sounds is okay but don t bother as i have sound bar tv takes sec to start slow in operation like going back to previous series or jumping to other plateform slim and very light weight but how does it matter as it will be hand on the wall final comments dont buy or at least see few videos in youtube before buying for experts comments i was blind with oneplus name and mobile fan for past several years and now i will be sorry for very long time picture quality and sound quality is excellent biggest disappointment with this tv was that this tv doesn t support ghz wifi bandwidth it still supports the ghz which i realised after everything was setup overall the tv is good picture quality is good not great but assuming the tv is for only rs i wasn t expecting much sound again isn t top notch but loud enough you will have to customise the sound settings a bit or if you really want that sround sound kinda effect you may need to buy an additional sound bar the remote connection is good and everything else is fine begel less is awesomethat is a good in one plusgreater better oneplus is worth the money as always this tv at that price tag is really a competitor to many other brands the best points from this tv include smart features minimal bezel frame picture google voice assistant customer friendly settingsone thing i wasn t accepting from this is its sound i used a samsung smart tv before this and its output itself sounded as if it was from a home theatre but the same output from oneplus was pathetic i even tried all their settings and features available i then ordered a jbl infinity home theatre only for the sound thing and then connected it over bluetooth it was then beautiful and perfect but after a couple of days there was a lag between the tv sound output and that from the home theatre i then replaced the jbl thing from amazon and to my surprise found out that even the next one had a similar issue after a couple of days i m still worried if the bluetooth feature of oneplus tv has an issue or just my specific piece this review of mine doesn t judge oneplus tv at any side it s just my experience other than the bluetooth lag at some times everything is at it s best and you can go for it without a second thought having dark patches at the bottom edge of the screen asked for the replacement not the way it was expected disappointed edit after a week or so got the tv replaced this one piece is ok and thanks to the tech team listening and addressed the issue as early as possible still i have some issue why the bluetooth once paired for speaker doesn t stay forever every time i had to unpair and pair the bluetooth after switching off and on the tv it s so irritating rest i m ok with the it this has some issues it was slow since the day i bought it i had read that this is the way it is designed it is a slow tv fine by me i bought it like a dumb a now after few months it stucks manufacturing defects were never considered and repaired before a launch go for it on your own risk ps risking isn t worth on this one go sky diving if you wanna risk so much overall meets the expectations at this price good for the price you pay software is buggy but nothing s deal breaking here picture quality its decent slim bezels you ll find backlit led bleeding in on the side overall it s a good quality for what you pay audio its hard to hear dialogues in the movies ull be needing a decent external speakers for sure the tv looks really good with thin bezels this tv has some serious software issue until or unless they rectify the issue i would not recommend this tv but yah i hope it can be resolved by a software update takes time more than month i guess software issues when unboxed it was fine after some days the software is getting lag the screen is getting fully red sometimes like the display has damaged but after restart or re set the tv it is getting normalized picture quality is not too awesome but yah if you could adjust the picture settings its nice but not awesome good aspects the remote is awesome if you connect it with bluetooth its damn good if it s not its bit laggy if you are watching the cable dish you don t need to change the input always to hdmi composite it will read the last input when you switch back on oneplus connect is working fine but yah its laggy you can change the below steps movements left right up down and select change the inputs hdmi composite back button google voice is working fine can open the apps download etc the tv sound is great not a dolby one but yah its good bad aspects not able to connect with alexa echo dot rd gen i have checked with the service team they told its might be a software issue and they also told they will sent a guy to resolve this technichal guy is not yet came some time the screen is getting fully red got resolved after re setting its irritating sometimes to re set the tv again and again while purchasing the tv the alexa echo dot rd gen its not free i have checked with the amazon they told its not free anymore wall mount is not with the tv we have to purchase it from the amazon technical guy and cost is around better to purchase it separately there is aspects to start tv when unplugged and re plug it its taking around sec to completely start the tv plugged and switch off from remote and switch on from the remote again its taking around secconclusion wont recommend to purchase now might be after resolving it by an software update might be take some month i guess after months of usage tv is getting stuck sometimes need to unplug and replug to start working again sometimes composite mode is not working only shows blue background for sec and comes back to home page hi team i bought this tv around months back and getting wifi issue and remote control problem from day and open a case with support team its been a month till now no resolution chasing care from oneplus care app twitter whatsapp mail support but no resolution i don t know when can i get resolution after months my warranty period will be over i dnt have hopes please think before you buy this is my personal experience iam not enforcing anyone this is after days i opened a ticket months back but till now there is no resolution customer care guys just closing the ticket and asking feedback there main focus is on feedback not on resolution other side i escalated to amazon still there is no resolution i don t know when i can get resolution i bought this tv from amazon after months one fine day i couldn t turn on the tv since i have paid for extra warranty i contacted amazon for technical support i scheduled the appointment times every time the technician didn t turn up and they reschedule it i was contacting oneplus as well nobody visited or tried to resolve the issue and keep on sending automated replies now it s been nearly months and still its not resolved i have bought this tv in august i have started facing lag glitches screen freeze since feb since then it s been calls to customer care service schedules and on hold status you will not get any help from amazon or qdigi one plus partner it s a bad launch i can t describe the months of harassment by amazon and one plus to finally telling me that my warranty is over now in august and no further help can be done without actually resolving anything first i received this product with a different stand and they send a replacement for this all this process took around month finally i got a working product after using it for months we were watching the tv suddenly it stopped working i raised a complaint immediately i waited for few days and started calling customer care every day the phone will be attending by different executives they will tell theirs on stories it will be assigned to technician or the call with escalated to you will get a call back so and so after a month and half the complaint got assigned to a technician and without visiting the site they told they have ordered for parts during all this time we were using our old tv good that we haven t sold at last they came the home with a tv and exchanged some parts with our tv the tv is working but one issue the tv display is coming opposite side if we rotate the tv only we will be able to see now they told me there are no settings in the remote to change the direction they will come with software to resolve this issue again the service person came and tried to fix it but still it s not resolved now they want to take the tv to service place and we have to get it from there not sure how much time it will take this is my experience with the oneplus tv i would suggest don t go for this product if you still want to buy then arrange an alternative and be ready i think that i should have bought mi x instead of this but the inch of mi x was not available on amazon and i don t like to buy from flipkart this oneplus tv has lot of lag issues since it has only gb of ram the optimization is poor the sound is not good at all for a room it is okay but after volume don t know if volume even increases instead the effect increases which compromises the quality of sound i recommend buying a soundbar does not power on by single click from remote some issue with that doesn t have new features like multicast only buy it if you re a oneplus fan otherwise go for mi x instead that provides k and better optimized performance low quality product bought in first sale sound quality is so poor returned after few days honest review let me write one by one review after weeks first of all i have pre booked oneplus y and availed the acko s years extended warranty and also amazon echo dot along with this tvwhich is worth to buy at k those who have missed echo dot i feel very sorry for them also alexa worked me as a smart connector between tv and my sony home theatre system without any digital cables or converters saved my money there too picture quality is pretty good and i led display viewing angle should be straight and if it s more than degree picture clarity will reduce and colours starts fading make sure you are straight infront of tv view sound quality is ok kind of quality at this price as i am depending more on home theatre speakers thus it s good for me value for money yes definitely you can choose at this budget unless like other brands of this range and it s chromecasting is built in can avail from ios platform too as i am using it includes all the modern smart tv features like netflix amazon youtube and google assistants in one single button but some time lag can be experienced while changing the input sources even google assistance is bit slow to catch up when compared to alexa overall i can give thanks team oneplus and amazon in pros contrast ratio is amazing black level is amazing viewing angles are fine awesome color accuracy latest android version cons poor quality speakers little bit lag probably the os as for speakers why would you use inbuilt speakers what matters most is contrast ratio color range viewing angles and clarity bit over pricingamazon installation installation has not completed waited for days then done with local technician amazon service is getting poorer the media could not be loaded google assistant is not working properly smartest smart tv from oneplus in this price range no other tv s has such picture quality and features its totally premium product just one thing pls buy soundbar or any sound system with this this tv has dolby digital dolby digital plus surround sound which are awesome functions indeed but u can feel these features only if u have external sound system else the speakers of w each are very low in volume a good movie with sound effects cant be enjoyed at all else this tv is highly recommended all the features works perfectly as the company says in ads value for money indeed one update after using the tv for month never faced problems like auto restart lags etc but yes if u install loads of apps then u should wait few seconds when u start the tv else u will see lil lags but after few seconds it will run smoothly tv works fine features are also impressive but the rigidity of the tv is questionable installation service by one plus was very poor the installation was scheduled between pm and they reached around pm and left around pm the fixed wall mount used was in rusted condition and they drilled total holes on the tv mounting board for screw and the wooden board got damaged the tv was tilted to one side after installation and then they had to use small paper pieces to level the tv for the fixed tv mount the charge was rs even though the charge written in amazon is rs for a tv by comparing with my friend mi tv oneplus is very bad the picture quality and sound quality is very poor comparing with his tv the remote control and voice recognition is perfect but the clarity of display is very bad according to mi tv till the reviewing date there is no inbuilt apps for screen casting etc we should seperatly want to download airscreen app from play store for installing other apps this tv not have file manager to download apk from usb we should also want to download that from play store i am damn sure that my friends mi tv is better than oneplus tv my rating to this tv is not worth this tv for better go for mi tv or other brands like tcl realme etc i think that oneplus will overall these products but in case of tv till i am putting the review mi tv is good by comparing with my friends tv the media could not be loaded this review is in usage of months worst product from oneplus i just don t even understand why they had to come into tv my personal opinion always go with sony or lg it is the best nd time issue with the display first issue arrived after months i bought the tv same as you see in the picture this image is second time issue but it was working for mins and it started to fade away i usually don t use the tv much so i didn t care about it for months then it started to fade forever so had to book a service nonsense in this pandemic it took months to fix fine atleast some picture to see in the second lockdown after the service and it didn t like to work after month after the st service same kind of issue this image is reference after st service done to display changing the whole display i personally recommend sony of lg they are best in tvs ofcourse they are high priced for what reason you guys might think this is the reason these guys i just don t understand why did i even step foot in these kinds of company s for a different product they are utter waste of time and money i have used the tv only for months that s it and i m in second services with one year bullshit what others think about this tv or the brand shame to say i m oneplus user for years now cheap quality displays they use so is the lowest price amazing product got it for k a ton of features added pixel quality is ok you can easily notice it with different colours using android enabled smart tv hence have same emotions like the way android works or probably the function processing capability of the tv is not at par tv remote sensor works only in you are in range of metres irrespective of inserting battery cells i feel my tata sky remote sensor was out of the world since it use to capture signals from any corner of the room where my old tv was installed piece of advise if you money to spend go for another brand or device altogether and you limited on budget i would recommend you to with this tv writing this review after days of usage picture quality was excellent for the pricesound was decent dont expect more better to go with a home theatresome lags in software hope these will be resolved soon by ota updatenice design and bezelless display is top notchinternet and dth connectivity is goodone con is that it donot have mm jack i bought optical converter separatelybluetooth remote was sleek and nicedont bother fake reviews and just go for itgood product from oneplus loved it simply amazing picture quality and sound awesome products display quality supersound quality ok the media could not be loaded very nice products one plus im impressed very reasonable rate and remote control is through blutooth killer tv at the the product itself is great value for money for less than k for a inch android led tv overall picture quality is great at normal viewing angles but the colours shift slightly at extreme wide viewing angles but it will be good enough in most situations there are lot of picture and sound settings it also supports dolby you can easily connect your bluetooth headset or soundbar sound quality lacks bass and punch it s not great for movies or songs but enough for usual news and sports for movies i suggest to use dedicated soundbar or home theatre remote control has only bluetooth functionality no infrared so battery drain might be faster sometimes tv lags to recognize remote operation tv stand is plastic and feels kinda weak it wobbles a bit when you nudge the screen there is no aux output only optical for audio out apparently hdmi arc is there but haven t tried it wifi connectivity is good and fast though it connects only to ghz bands tv has only gb ram so it tends to lag a bit while running more than apps in background but it s acceptable in normal circumstances there seems to be no surge protection so better to connect it to a stabilizer if your electricity fluctuates often usb pen drives can be connected and we can also choose different audio languages in the movie files if available which is great it s a great tv for the price more worth than sony or lg which are well above k for android models of same size i think it has a better display than mi tv panasonic or realme tv i used this for more than months finally put the tv for exchange when it was still under warranty couldn t tolerate the awfulness anymore it was very slow even when there are only apps installed i literally have to wait for nearly a minute to switch to another app and play a movie sound quality was very poor if there s some bass in any scene that am watching there is an irritating static noise big mistake to have bought this seeing one plus brand name mi has better tv in the same price range don t think there will be negative reviews for all the brands and avoid what am writing am serious and writing this out of frustration please avoid this tv good the tv display dint start after using weeks no idea to the service agent what the problem is service agent says you will have issue resolved in a week mail by digicare comes saying issue not in scope of warranty what is the problem just days and this is the condition of tv regretting myself buying it on first sale should have gone for mi or samsungplease look into this amazon and oneplus i am quite happy with the product weightless tv great job by one plus the media could not be loaded it s hardly one month and the tv is unusable volume keeps increasing and screen flickers to the bottom cannot control the tv through remote reached out to customer care and the response very slow update sep customer care replaced the remote and it did not solve the issue more than a month that i raised a complaint and the problem still exists pathetic support amazon just keeps escalating the issue without resolution awesome tv avoid buying this tv it s seems cheap but so is the performance i bought this tv one week back and in this one week i have faced the following problems on tv has hung frozen four times audio was on but video was completely blanked out once lag when bluetooth headphone is connected and the audio breaks replacement cannot be done until service centre guy checks it service centre person never turns up despite multiple follow ups raised the issue with amazon on th and still waiting for some service centre person to pick my call and attend to the problemdissapointing the media could not be loaded very good tv excellent picture quality perfect for a common man s middle class family perfect as per expectations never thought i will have to write a negative feedback for oneplus products we insisted our parents to buy this tv and we are regretting it the tv constantly hangs and everytime we ask for a return or for replacement of the product a technician is been appointed to check the tv i really don t know how to sync the timing of technician and the time when tv hangs to be at the same time really disappointed by the product and also by amazon because i still don t have any clarity whether or not there is going to be replacement or refund or not requesting amazon to kindly provide the relevant information and solve the grevieneces of geneiue customers note i have called amazon customer service for atleast timesawaiting a positive response from amazon i installation not done properly i have registered my complaintsound is not great buy vu cinema tv for good soundpicture quality is goodui is goodremote is good clutter free simple cute after using for one month now there is display issues i am really not happy with oneplus purchase lags a lot sony home theatre connected to the tv worked fine for the first month but post some software update started to face too many issues home theatre not getting recognised remote issue the one plus customer service is very bad they take weeks to respond they are yet to come and check what the issue is bought the tv on the first day it was launched but regrett now very upsetting experience worth the money and the quality is splendid awesome the remote stopped working it isnt damaged by any means i don t know now how to use the tv as nothing can work without remote so useless product as expected from china there is a lot of lag while operating the tv with remote to switch on the tv i need to try atleast times and if it still does not work i need to manually switch on the tv by pressing the button behind tv i really like the one plus brand but tv definitely is not up to the mark can t handle the lag sometimes it s very frustrating after paying so much money and can t do anything when the remote does not work i m sure i definitely can use connect feature on my one plus mobile phone as remote but what s the tv remote for when it does not do what it is supposed to do giving review after month of usage one of the worst tv s i have ever seen avg display avg sound doesn t switch on as soon as i power on from the remote need to press at least times to switch on tv there s a lot of lag for volume buttons sometimes tv itself goes to home page from live tv and doesn t go back to live tv need to switch off tv and switch it on again after month of usage tv hanged up a few times the tv even doesn t connect to oneplus connect app need to find tv on mobileapp for so much time sometimes even after many trails i can t connect to my tv even opening and closing apps is very laaagggggyyyyy the media could not be loaded very nice i bought this tv based on my experience with one plus phone contrary to the quality of the phones the tv quailty has proven to be nightmare for me on top of that their service is poor the option to register complaint through amazon gives no result st the display was not proper after complaining they took two months to change the display the new display lasted only days and now its completely black screen with few colored lines its been days i have raised complaint to both amazon and one plus directly but all in vain i will not recommended this tv to anyone i have two more tvs at my home both samsung never faced any such issue samsung has the same price and same features i wish i can replace it for samsung and now its the third time that the tv is down rd time in warranty period just today the installation guy came and install the tv perfectly st glanacethis is almost an bezel less tv i cannot expect much in this price but the design is quite stylishsecondly it took some time for start at first timebut then after it is smooth nd galanceafter completed all the setups on tv for its specs gb ram it is super smooth no doubt there is an delay of to seconds but that ok as tv used frequently then that delays also minimises rd glanacethe sound is grt for this price point it s not that you purchase a tv under k and ten compared it with k tv that s unfair but the tv comes with dolby atoms and dolby atmos both features for sound th finalelastly google assistant works pretty well with this tv too it response time is in milliseconds impressed with the product quality and design performance is also decent video quality is quiet good audio not up to the expectations terrible installation service technician never contacted even after days from the delivery date contacted amazon many times had to reschedule times canceled the service at last like the title of my review said i am going to only list down the factual pros and cons after a day of using the tv elaborately and let you decide for yourself pros great picture quality especially if content is in hd the smart tv features that allows you to pair it with your phone laptop bluetooth speakers bluetooth headphones etc are super handy the screen size of is just perfect for your room unless it is ultra spaciouscons the sound w is loud enough but the quality is really poor and one dimensional so you will surely need an external sound system or sowaker the finishing of the product is not the best one can tell how oneplus managed to price this at k when you pay attention to how they ve cut corners on the quality the oneplus logo on the front is titled first time i ve ever seen this on a product from a reputed brand there s a considerable gap between the display and top corner bezels and the plastic finishing isn t even there s a lag when you re operating the tv switching between apps browsing content and giving google assistant voice commands of the time hoping oneplus fixes it with future software updates but so far there s no official word on thatthose are my pros and cons in a nutshell now the decision is yours hello please do not buy tv from online because i bought one plus tv on june th within months display went off after that i am trying for warranty claim but it s been days still no one from amazon responding properly i don t know when issue will be resolved so better go to local vendor and buy electronic items atleast we can ask that guy if any problem occurs i like vry much i bought this tv in pre booking the tv quality is adequate there is nothing good about it after months my tv face an issue where hdmi ports were non functional it has been days yet i complained both amazon and oneplus for the warranty but both are unable to repair it because of scarcity of parts oneplus is not the same brand it used to be the products are pathetic and sub standard nice tv as far as display and sound is concerned the tv is a good buy but the tv lags very much the processor isn t that powerful i don t know how at the launch time the demos work so fine navigating between sources apps volume control is very laggy switching tv on is very tricky sometimes it takes button clicks to turn on tv this issue is same with mi tvs as well the output of video quality is really good but the tv lags very oftenly major manufacturing problem in all y series inch television is with hdmi port the screen keeps flickering or goes blank for seconds if connected to hdmi tried with different devices in hdmi port to confirm the issue i got the tv replaced but the same error again persists even with the replacement tv hence it s confirmed that there is some manufacturing deffect with this model of television great product value for money go for it reviewing after using the product for a month picture quality is awesome it will beat many other competitors in this price range but not that great as boasted in the launch event sound quality is average but you have to make some changes in the settings to get a good sound output but compared to motorola and realme tv in this price range it ll lose in this tv to get a good sound output you have to max the volume software is the point where i got disappointed from one plus i expected many things because it s a tv from oneplus the tv lags a little bit control from the tv remote takes seconds for the tv to operate i hope one plus gives a good proper update to clear this problem ram is gb and the storage is gb out of which the available is gb motorola has gb of free space so a little disappointment but it s a tv after all not a smartphone input ports works fine and u won t get a mm port opening an app takes some time which is a little irritating as said about the oneplus connect app it s not that hype what you saw during the launch event one annoying thing is you have to open a oneplus connect app from the tv and then you can use it from your smartphone typing option is not available sometimes the tv doesn t open youtube have to restart the tv and then open youtube if oneplus is seeing this review i expect you to solve the software issue regarding the lag which annoys a lotone more thing i couldn t connect alexa to this tv also i couldn t connect google remote overall it s a good budget tv but it s not that buttery smooth if the software issue is solved then this tv will be a great budget tv i hope my review helps you amazing the media could not be loaded hd best quality product at a cheap price amazing as it should be nice tv under k got a faulty remote straight out of the box with neither oneplus nor amazon taking responsibility and both asking me to approach the other as a manufacturer oneplus should ideally honour warranty replacements especially when the product is less than hours old and faulty right out if you re buying this be warned that oneplus support is super apathetic and you ll probably be left fending for yourself tv is fine ish as a product nothing exceptional it s rife with software bugs and lags can t even download apps because they all get stuck on pending go for an amazon firetv a non smart tv with a fire stick an apple tv or just assemble one yourself you ll have a better experience than with this garbage product and company this has been one hell of a let down it isnt a bad tv but something about it that leaves me disappointed i have had many tvs sony lg mi vu they have all add something to vow this one comes out as very ordinary but if you are burying it its not the tv that will bother you its the service its been weeks since i raised a complaint they have done nothing about it tweeting calling mailing nothing has worked so my advise look for someone who respects your business excellent the tv i bought is not worth its too damn slow it starts and switches off on own installation was not proper may be even after resetting everything the tv works on its own n is very damn slow voice commands does not work review after a week pros less bezel not bezel less screen quality is okay for the price range cons muffled audio no bass not even b of bass software glitches remote response time is slow color reproduction not accurate no ir for remote cheap material a mediocre at best product from oneplus the media could not be loaded very worst company and very bad customer support i have purchased this one plus y tv on july and tv display has gone on aug i have complained and talk to many times to amazon and one plus care they only send technicians for visit i m writing this review after days from complaint date and still they are saying that due to unavailable of parts i am not able to repair your tv they are just making fool to indian user pls don t buy and don t suggest to any one the product came faulty out of the box within two months of purchase there were visible lines and blacked out picture when connected to a set top box so finally one day the product decided to quit with no picture but just rgb lines on display see for the details in shared pic now coming to the service part it s been almost months since i am trying to get it serviced or repaired by amazon product support agency well it is a new year now still no luck the customer care executives are a bunch of fools with no remors of your problem their constant jab is wait for hrs problem will be resolved they provide you with all sorts of misinformation regarding their product support one told me it will be fulfilled by oneplus honestly oneplus don t give a flying duck about customer or later in product support with multiple calls and false promises i called back amazon cs this is when i came to know the product and service will be done by amazon anyway after multiple calls and escalations till date no one visited an engineer was scheduled to visit while he didn t and contacted me via call and asked me to click picture of the problem and send me via whatsapp after looking upon it he told me it s a manufacturing defect and will be replaced at the earliest well later received a mail from amazon stating support has been cancelled so the moral of the story is the struggle is real purchase one plus at your own risk don t trust amazon for any service related query very good picture quality enjoying watching movies sound quality require some improvement easy to connect with app very good installation service lots of one start in review are due to not getting alexa offer and faulty products and installation service regarding alexa they mentioned it s free or on less price but as there routine offer it s not kept easily available u have to check and add offer in u r cart which is not expected from amazon it heart s if you buy product and not got offered alexa so my sincere request to amazon if u are willing to give any offer keep it easy and don t hide it else didn t give what we are getting in this price one tv we are happy thanks worst tv experience that i have ever had in my life with this tv worst customer service experience and service amazon kept the promise of contacting the manufacturer which was to harsh for a month old tv tv had bad screen issue remote issue waiting for the drama to get over from the one plus side screen flickering is the most common problem half of the times tv doesn t start with a single button press by the remote booting takes at least seconds screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time system lag is the maximum in this class of tv s most of the apps doesn t work which is downloaded from playstore youtube apps crashes many times airtel extreme doesn t work picture quality doesn t beyond p even if play the k video overall the bad experience which is never expected from the brand like oneplus the media could not be loaded don t buy oneplus tv i bought oneplus y series in tv with in one and half month tv screen problem i search technician in chennai vellore and kanchipuramnot available in district then i realised total tamilnadu technician not availablelocal service man told that you complaint register to customer care then he will guide you like that my first complaint registered sep th still to times following for recovery of complaintbut more than month completed still my tv problem not solvedso don t buy oneplus tv the media could not be loaded i bought oneplus y series smart tv on sep and during the initial usage i felt like this was the best grab for the price because oneplus gives its superior build quality and smart features and everything seems to be fine for first months literally everything was good but after two months of usage the tv suddenly started showing display issues such as change in colour flickering etc and this issue disappears when the tv is restarted again this issue started appearing on random basis and goes when restarted so when this happened multiple times i myself recorded a video and pictures of the same and contacted amazon for the service believe me this is where it all started to become worser the technician visited my home and confirmed it that the tv is having manufacturing defect as it doesn t have any physical damage from then it almost took months of continued followup with amazon customer care to solve my issue the issue was escalated multiple time and still was not resolved i talked with superior associate still they also couldn t solve my issue at last after multiple complaints and escalation on priority basis and to management level they had to accept the return as an exception oneplus brand didn t meet the expectations in its tv good i thought that oneplus name might have a good quality product for tv like mobiles but they failed after the purchase of tv with in a month the remote stopped working and when raised a issue with oneplus customer care they sent a service person and he confirmed me that the remote is faulty and will be replaced with a new one but after days of complaint registered still they haven t provided a remote all they do is close the ticket after few days and asked to open a new one for the same complaint they say that they don t have a spare remote and this is the response from one plus customer care and they don t know when they might have it days without remote that too on the early days after the tv lauch they are not good with service all they are good with one time sales worst support in the industry brand new one plus tvs are having issues with bluetooth connectivity i have observed this issue after the return window is over else could have returned it one plus being such a reputed company this is not great on their part looks like they are now compromising on the quality to bring the prices down to compete with the like of other chinese players bad experience i would recommend to go for established brands such as lg samsung panasonic etc super one plus tv tv overall experience is perfect the only problem i had was with my sound system i have a sony sound system when i connect my tv to the soundbar the sound out is from both the tv and the external sound which is annoying i feel as if i m sitting in a room where the sound is echoing a software update should fix the issue stay away from this tv this is worst thing you can buy with your money everything is pathetic about this tv except may be display which is average at best the remote is so slow the inbuilt chromecast never works the wifi connectivity is of the lowest grade among all devices worst of all they market it like it is the best thing in the world please save yourselves and don t fall for the trap it s been only days that i ve been using it but my initial reviews about this tv is fairly positive the picture quality is very good viewing angles could ve been better but the colour and full hd output is excellent the sound quality is pretty average considering it is powered by dolby audio the system lags a little but that can be excused considering the price overall this tv is catch and if you are on budget this can be a go to option i ll update the review after thoroughly using this tv excellent marvelous exciting i returned the product as soon as i bought it i considered this tv just for the brand value and trust i had on oneplus since i own a oneplus phone but oneplus disappointed me pros cost picture quality for this cost p android oscons sound quality not good enough even volume sounds like a watching the same content on a oneplus was louder display looked flimsy and was not firmly attached to the frame problem in hdmi port seems a software problem which led to random loss if signals on the hdmi port apparently this is an issue in multiple sets finally the problem was solved after a s w update but now any time tv is turned on it automatically switches off and has to be turned on again started after the latest software update host of other problems as well whenever media is played from usb the tv goes into sleep mode and stops after minutes this is despite disabling the sleep timer and other power save options as well truly ridiculous product with stupid problems even if you consider the price range between this and the phone started to realise oneplus is just big hype products are sub standard its been almost an year now i bought thus tv it really matched my al expectations the picture quality is really good the performance is flawless and never ever lagged as of now the wifi response of tv is good it really gives smooth buffet free all the content the contentivity of tv is really good it connects ti my wifi devices in no time few problems which i found was the audio quality is not upto the mark the speakers are not loud enough the voice recognition sometimes fails over all experience has been really good so far tv hangs randomly have to switch it completely off at least once a day and switch on again the apps malfunction netflix exits on its own sometimes youtube opens when we hit the netflix button on the remote remote connectivity is also not fool proof sometimes it gets stuck while fast forwarding to connect to different bluetooth device have to disconnect from the current one as there is no option to scan when connected to a device already the tv has most features but they will malfunction sometimesvoice recognition doesn t work this tv takes so much time to get start since we bought this it is having an issue with start up and sudden switch off issue but we did not get the replacement even the amazon is not helping in this and says we don t have policy for the return of the product why it should not be returnable on a day one good i just have a single suggestion don t go for it i ignored the reviews while purchasing the product stating there are lot of glitch in the tv software i thought those glitches would go after the update but it didn t happen the tv has lot of problems it started from day problems with product youtube and other apps crashes all of the sudden volume key most of the times doesn t work tv doesn t respond to the remote almost all the time chromecast doesn t work pros picture quality is average sound quality is good tv build up quality is good plz dont purchase this specific product with amazone because of customer service center not provide you priority service because of you are amazons customer not oneplus brand s so i m suggesting purchase threw brand so thet will give you proper service after delivery of my tv i m getting my installation after days and now i want to claim warranty because of product issue with internet connectivity so now one plus customer care executive not replying me properly and amazon customer service dont do anything because of warranty given by one plus not amazone pathetic tv it does not connect to the sony music system the guy who came was just in a hurry to fix it and run did not clearly explain things and did not give solution to connect the home theatre despite asking him day it is not detecting set top box even though the hdmi is plugged in properly having a tough time with the tv the biggest mistake in my life was to go for this tv i will give zero stars for this product suggestion spend a little more and get a better established television brand the media could not be loaded this tv is not great or not worst i liked the picture quality in this range and bezel less view is awesome attached picture however not having aux support is minus sound quality of tv is poor poor and loud sound doesn t help and recently i ve found a dead pixel on the screen of which i ve attached the picture technician came and checked it received an update saying waiting for warranty part will update how everything went once anything is done updating on received replacement part received part was replaced to tv with original one executive messed it up and tv is not showing true colors now to say it is showing negative like colors looking trust on amazon day by day chatted with agent called seizel who is stubborn and not at all listening rescheduled a service appointment will see what will happen and update here will not recommend this product strongly overall so so experience like the tv overall good picture quality and software interface i would recommend it however i feel the following could have been done differently the sound quality isn t all that impressive the speakers aren t loud enough i m using additional speakers with my tv the processor used is quite slow i see apps hanging at times which forces me to reboot the tv the setup process wasn t very smooth when i first started the tv i couldn t install or update apps i had to reset the tv to get the play store working i can t find a way to boot the tv to the home screen it directly boots to the live tv interface i don t have cable or set top box so this doesn t make sense to me if there is a way i haven t been able to find out how yet after searching a lot online the base of the tv doesn t feel stable one has to take a lot of care if one wants to move the tv it s very inconvenient that the ports in the center especially because of point if your tv is on the table this makes it hard to access the ports we have to move the tv to access the ports and makes it difficult the ports should have been placed on the side since usb is the port i ll be using the most i got around the problem by purchasing a usb cable that i can access without moving the tv i went for the in tv instead of the in one just because i don t have place to keep the larger in tv if you have place for the in tv and if it fits into your budget i would recommend going for that one it would have been nice if oneplus offered a in tv with all the in features for a slightly higher price than the current in tv good tv superb picture quality craaaaazy user interface within a month of purchase tv started hanging need to press remote times to get it started loggged a complaint on april and upto today issue is not resolved and one plus customer care is saying we can not tell you when it will get repaired first and last oneplus product worst experience review update on i have contacted customer care several times and still they haven t responded amazon customer care just says that they follow up the matter but still i havnt received any updates regarding they matter they just don t value people s money these people just wanna sell the product n don t wanna know elwhat happens after salei have one plus mobile so i thought that tv will be having the same quality the tv is awesome but the service from oneplus amazon is worst display n all is good but tv don t have any built in quality the main board of the tv was damaged within one month of use and till now these amazon oneplus people havnt done anything to get it replaced it s your money so please don t invest in these items were they don t even bother to give a service worst experience i am facing dont go for appliances in amazon installation process will not done by actual slot they will change as per their convenient my tv delivered on may and installation slot booked on may but no one contacted me for installation while call back to customer care they simply saying wait for weeks and weeks if we wait for installation for weeks what is the use of buying these products go for flipkart they are doing same day installation too lose full hope on amazon no one responding properly please dont buy any appliances in amazon if u buy u will face same problem which i am facing i had worst ever than worst experience with oneplus tv very low quality build material cheaper hanging restarting problem when you switching between app google assistant not working since i update the android version sound quality is the biggest setback it sounds like a rd rate speaker and sound isn t balanced there is no clarity in the sound you won t be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen frame of tv isn t durable it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute remote is very slow it takes time and you have to proper focus infront of tv bad policy of amazon technician from oneplus visit to solve but failed technician from amazon come two time for inspection failed to solve they are not able to do anythingso i will not suggest to purchase oneplus tv a lot of problems writing this review after using the tv over than a month the picture quality is doubtlessly good sound is average not good for a big room there are problems with remote control for eg sometimes when the volume button is pressed on tv remote the set top box is responding with recall command chromecast does slow response sometimes the tv automatically goes to home page a software updating is inevitable for addressing this problems design bug currently version had been installed in my device everytime restart power on reset takes the time to jan pm because of this google products aren t working unless i change the time settings manually to current date and time so i strongly recommend to take opinion from other users too am planning to raise service request on this issue to amazon the display is hdready n worst color saturation n brightness is killing after watching for min for days i ruined my eyes and when contacted amazon they say follow up n complain to one plus in return one plus rngennier resettled while tv which ruined the display more n it is so bright that u see white patches n if reduce the background light n brightness color s gets dark one plus not ready to listen or change the tv i think i have done blunder by purchasing only in the name of one plus be informed pl don t blindly buy see it to believ it i have contacted amazon multiple times and every time i get the same answer there is no stock for replacement i am clueless about what should be my next step extremely bad after sales services worst better to get a tv from local store than such products back in july oneplus launched its budget tvs line up i prebooked the tv on the launch day itself after around two weeks the tv went on flash sale for the first time i received the tv after a week i got the tv for around rs i prebooked the device for rs which gave me two years extended warranty and rs amazon cashback also i got amazon echo dot for free and a tv which i returned and got a refund for the same it was a great deal and so i decided to go for the oneplus tv with an excellent price tag it comes with some exciting features like oneplus connect dolby audio enhancement oxygen play chromecast google assistant built in and compatible with amazon alexa i was very much excited to unbox and try the oneplus tv it also comes with android unboxing the tv and attaching the table mount was an easy process also setting up the device was very easy initial impressions when i first started the device it was lagging a lot however there was already a software update available when i just started the device i quickly updated the device and the tv was still not working smooth enough i think going gb ram is not enough the picture quality is impressive and the sound quality isn t good at default settings after tweaking the sound it sounded terrific regarding connectivity it was very smooth the bezel less design was the most attractive part of the tv design the design is the most decisive point of the tv it comes with a bezel less display an screen to body ratio and an enhanced viewing experience it is slim from the back of the tv also the ports are accessible quite easily the table mount is also of decent quality and there is a led indicator in the bottom right corner of the tv overall i loved the design and form factor of the tv rating display the display comes with a bunch of fancy features it comes with a p resolution and has dci p provides excellent colour reproduction it uses gamma engine for picture enhancement and has features like anti aliasing noise reduction dynamic contrast and colour space mapping it also comes with various display tweaks such as sports mode movie mode and many others but i just tweaked them to get the best out of the tv the default settings aren t as good as expected after tweaking the colours and overall picture quality is soothing although i think the fps doesn t look smooth enough it seems like fps to sum up the display is excellent at this price point although you need to tweak the settings to get the best out of the display rating sound it comes with a w speaker output and also supports dolby audio enhancement the default sound settings aren t sounding that great after tweaking the audio settings it works at its best it is loud enough and no complaints apart from default settings rating connectivity we get all the required connectivity options it comes with ghz wi fi bluetooth ethernet rf connection input hdmi input av input digital audio output and usb ports and the most legendary feature is the oneplus connect we can control the tv entirely using a phone take screenshots of the tv and save and share it you can also control the tv actions such as volume switch input open apps and turn off tv using amazon echo dot but there is an issue with the remote tv won t power on off on the first attempt it also doesn t have a dedicated input switch button rating pros awesome colour accuracy dci p and beautiful display quality great sound quality with features like dolby audio enhancement dialogue enhancer dolby surround etc oneplus connect app features like taking tv screenshots controlling tv etc aggressive price point amazon echo dot integration and google assistant built in bezel less display enhances the viewing experience cons it lags a lot at times and especially after turning on the tv from sleep mode tv won t power on the first attempt of the times default audio and display settings aren t the best gb ram isn t enough for the tv no wall mount inside the box no input switch button on the remote really loved the optv y serieshave some lil probs bt thts finee hope oneplus will fix this in next update everything works fine so farlittle lag bt it s okay it happens in every android tvoneplus tv is handy with oneplus mobile phones but doesn t support screen cast with mi phonesaudio n video quality is top notch need to change in settings overall best for this price range writing this review after a month of use pros compare to other tv in this price range sound quality is good smooth installation after paying installation charges around k plus including wall mount picture quality is goodcons voice recognition is annoying bluetooth paring is messy some time u need to unpair and pair again in case of u r connecting a sound at no aux cable port it doesn t support aux cable not possible to connect home theater system to this tv before purchasing they mentioned aux cable support but after delivery no any aux support pin in this tv i am very dissatisfied about this tv to connect external sound system the media could not be loaded picture quality is unbelievable cast on screendelayed and audio is not syncpicture qualitypixel quality is not upto markarrived after days of tv delivered date poor service from amazon they have provided the installation service person out of service mobile number till the end of alloted time none of them called and best part is they have told to forward this issue to next hours to solve this issue the amazon service is totally poor they have told that service person will provide log sheet and one year warranty time but that hasn t been provided there wasn t any wall mount so finally not worthy bad product no alexa support and aweful customer service surprised that one plus tv not that good sound quality is poor rough no changes like cinema voice music etc modes available as in other brands had to put a soundbar to get a decent sound do please personally visit a showroom and listen to the tv sound before buying one plus tv it does have a really good picture quality and the sound is also satisfactory voice recognition works well and smart features are good but there are so many bugs in the software causing youtube and prime video to not work properly i don t know if it s the cpu or the ram it s super slow and hangs for like minutes which will only get fixed if we pull the power line not having an rca or mm output is bad and most importantly alexa never works in the tv the tv turns off and disconnect from the wi fi causing alexa unable to control it plenty of bugs in that sector and seriously disappointed with oneplus coming up with such a product but considering the price range it s good still can be improved way better the media could not be loaded i think this is great android tv i got this it is definitely worth the money i am reviewing this product after using it for days one thing that really annoyed me is that i got this for and a week after the price dropped to i know it s not a big deal but rupees is a big amount and i could have saved it i will mention some pros and cons of product below and this might help you to make up your mind before you decide to purchase the product positive points picture quality the picture quality is superb at this price range it looks great the colours are very bright and the contrast ratio of tv is also very good the viewing angles on tv are also nice i have uploaded a video regarding it you can check it out smart cum android tv this is not just a smart tv but it is an android tv this means you can install and sideload any apps you like as per your liking i sideloaded a couple of apps and they all worked in first attempt earlier i was looking to go for samsung and lg but both those tv in this price range only offers smart tv features and you can t side load apps in a smart tv that s why android tv is best attractive looks one of the main reason why i bought one plus tv was because of the reason how good it looks it almost looks like a bezel less display because the bezels on tv are super thin and sleek the tv surely looks very attractive and it this price range you won t find many tv s as good looking as this operating system the os provided by one plus along with this tv is very smooth and it looks very clean and runs smooth most of the times you might notice a little bit of lag while opening heavy application but it is hardly noticeable in this price you can t really ask for much as tv only comes with gb of ram and despite that tv runs pretty smooth connectivity connectivity is smooth and fluid i connected my xbox controller to play some games via steamlink and my bluetooth controller was detected as soon i plugged it in wifi also connects within seconds of booting the tv the boot time of tv is also decent enough and only takes seconds for tv to boot negative points sound the sound quality of the tv is fine it is nothing special and not bad either the sound quality is little above average i think it could have been a little better price price drop pissed me off i mean come on i paid extra and one week later the price dropped that s unfair the tv is worth at k too but it could have been a classic deal if i got this at k mirror cast mirror casting from phone has a lot of delay even though i have a very fast network all in all this tv is really good and i loved it important info you will be charged rupees at time of installation of tv if you want to get the tv mounted on wall the installation will be done at time of delivery and will be done by same people who deliver the tv the delivery person will call you and inform you regarding the same for inches they will charge and for above inches you will be charged my installation went very smooth and at first tv was not mounted properly so i requested person to put that in perfect position and he gladly did that for me overall i am satisfied with both the product and installation i am using this product for the last months over it is goodpicture quality good can it be bettersound goodsmart feature average voice recognization and some other features are not working as expected remote control very bad if you like to use a remote you need to be very close to the tv minimum ft which is not expected for a smart tv smart remote is a very important accessory without the remote you can t do anything build quality average it s could be better after delivered my one plus led tv on i just purchase tata sky new d h conection with hd pack and after installation as well as activation of hd pack then same saw hd channel picture quality is vvvv bad dont buy for hd picture but sd picture not bad finally hd users go to samsung lg and videocon better than one plus inch pl thank for read it s a marvellous smart tv and extremely satisfactory features true to the oneplus brand but the biggest let down is the remote it s a really crude piece of plastic with jutting keys that are too cluttered closely and get activated at the slightest pressure there is no luminous keys and contouring is really a big let down it is a nuisance to use the remote and a very big disappointment i am writing this review after using this tv for months and i received two updates in months tv picture quality is amazing you get the best viewing experience but sound and it s android is pathetic from starting i see lags in this tv and i thought it get resolved after updates but it s not resolved yet syetem interface is really slow if you re planning to buy this tv go for upper one plus tv not this one picture quality amazingremote control very soft speedy oprationsound quality quite dispointed but not bad for inches tv overall oneplus is best as other comparative i am used oneplus mobile from last years only amezon service was very bad not customer supportive the media could not be loaded this is after week of usage watch attached video after speaking to amazon customer care they have assigned some amazon service agent the agent said he will fix the issue but even after months there is no resolution to my issue never expected such a worst service from amazon purchase even after reaching to cc they said they will sendsome technician but till now after days no one reached i request who ever see this review never ever purchase from amazon site products i ll give rating tv screen is defective after using months and amazon is not providing warrenty claim for the tv upon raising service request amazon mark it completed without any technician i suggest not to buy this product from amazon because you will not get any warrenty claim if product is defective one year warranty claim is fake amazon is not providing any warrenty claim don t buy from amazon tv is absolutely value proposition all required features are in the tv if you have a one plus phone then its a quick sync for first time installation dislike does not come with a wall mount stand the hd cable requirement is a cable these offset you by an additional amount depending on what you add on also you need to proactively call the installation guys as they were not aware of my installation job guys please don t buy oneplus tv and it s not a good product we bought a new tv months old and now it s not working now i have called the support and written back and forth emails but no support it s a worst support which i have never seen till today go for the mi or samsung user interface is good sound quality is poor have to use external speakers for clear sound better options are available in this price range edit after using the tv for months i have downgraded my rating form two to one star bluetooth connectivity is very poor you get delayed response the screen has started bleeding already have a bright line on the screen which is spreading with each passing day worst tv in this budget don t buy it go for other options not recommended at all i bought this product in october and the installation date given was month later yet the technician had no mood to install it further the television worked fine for months and one fine day its screen display went dark we thought it was a tata sky set talk box issue but later the other hdmi slot also went dark i have been calling amazon every single day to provide a warranty repair but for the past fifteen days they are not able to arrange a technician to visit us i m fed up calling and explaining the issue again and again i m now looking for a refund r else i will be forced to go to the consumer forum total waste of money got the tv in flash sale and in only month remote control stopped working asked for technical support the amazon guy came for inspection and found the remote control faulty and told that it will get replaced but did not get any replacement till date neither amazon is responding properly neither one plus is responding will suggest buying some other product from a local vendor to get support on an immediate basis picture quality is good look feel is good sound is tv build quality is goodonly gb memory is available out of gb oxygen play is useless apps take sec to openso much lag in tvtake sec to startapp close automatically because of lack of memorydidn t expect from oneplus for such a pover product go for realme tv bought the tv on th october tv was not working by september and made a warranty claim at amazon they lagged it till december th and said they can t provide warranty claim and the manufacturer has to provide oneplus declined to provide warranty saying the warranty period was over i blame both amazon and oneplus for such pathetic service to their customers i bought this the delivery boy asked me for otp on entering the door then he plugged in the tv holding in hand and said it turns on and was about to leave i asked to put the tv on stand and then switch it on he asked for otp again and entered itthis meant delivery was done then i started looking at the picture and he left i did nt like the quality its grainy lags a lot i call amazon and turns out my tv sale was final and not eligible for refund must have been written in fine print why didn t the delivery boy explain this to me i feel cheated with a tv i don t think i ll be able to use the media could not be loaded dont buy this tv very bad experience far better mi tv i have used airtel dth for watching tv when i start tv in the tv side corner moving option of netflix you tube etc why this option reflecting here while watching tv there is no any option to remove this not pair remote with dth remote when i start tv there is no option to set automatically redirect hdmi option so normally start my tv i don t want online content i want only dth connection tv you have to always manually select hdmi return option is not available no service after saleno person comes for service in warranty period keeping calling amazon they just keep on reshedule it every week u can check the service rating of tvpicture quality its max supptred clarity is there but if u want more go for k and more moneysound i dont need my home theatre now in average close bedroom it sounds sufficentconenctivty from andriod mobile to my laptop pendirve can play anything hereabout my orderfirst i got tv which was faulted no installtion guy came from service provider that was shocking form me that too times they said no comingamazon support team helped me nicely got my order replaced and installed while tv is good the fitting wall mount from amazon is pathetic and flimsy the tv is literally shaking and might fall off with a slight touch i d rather recommend buying it from somewhere else or directly from store this is my third review as my other reviews are not added unless i rate it high hypocrisy from amazon the media could not be loaded really had a nice viewing experience delivery was delayed a bit shipped through delhivery courier service myself installed the tv though the technician is scheduled one plus doesn t provide any wall mounting brackets tv is light weight sound quality is superb good video quality perfect at this price range as i have checked the reviews i saw that some of them have faced remote connectivity is very slow but i have experienced a very good response with remote control i didn t face any network connectivity issue also i was able to access the internet through mobile hotspot and was able to play pixel quality videos on youtube while accessing the tv through one plus connect app both the tv and mobike should be connected to same wifi network if we get a call it automatically mute the volume it s a good option finally it s very easy to operate as it have original android without any second thought you can go for it picture quality good sound quality okconnectivity good having problems with oneplus connect app may be some usage guidelines will help remote operating worst i think this is one of main drawback of this product we have to point the remote staight into the bottom of the tv other wise remote control os not working i guess it s do with the ram the display went wrong after hardly a month without any physical damage to the screen while going through the reviews what i understand is this issue of display is a common problem and not an isolated issue to this brand though in the amazon q a it is mentioned that the product is having comprehensive year warranty no body has till date attended my complaint the product is having service centres only in limited area never buy this tv the media could not be loaded was initially happy with quality for the cost but stopped working within a month of installation plays for and about a minute and screen goes rainy then tv switches off automatically won t turn on for next minutes even if mains power is restarted i hardly write product reviews but the great experience with the product made me go for it writing this review after a use of months excellent product fulfilling all the expectations picture and sound quality i am more than happy with it nothing less than established brands i initially was worried as i had not used or heard much about tv sets but i am completely satisfied got it for k in offer period with exchange of my years old led wall installion feature settings was done at the time of delivery with no hassle cons sd channels quality is distinguished over hd due to increased screen size streaming hd data gives theatre feel remote batteries come from local brand do not last longer i switched to duracell in less than months would strongly recommend to go for it note holding a fifth star to watch for the prolonged usage experience not able to connect with alexanot able to connect with oneplus connect app google assistant on tv do not understand anything can anyone help me connecting alexa and oneplus connect app with this tv several emails written to oneplus support team but no reply pros excellent picture quality sound quality is good but don t know why many are telling negative about the sound quality remote control is sleek and responsive connectivity is goodcons very high picture brightness not good for kids sometimes connect mobile app works weird lagging very rare over all best television at this price with some issues here and there i have purchased one plus tv inch from amazon after purchase with in days time my tv screen got blured completely so i done the complain in one plus than they replaced my complete pannel of tv its been only more days and once again this screen got blured its showing blank suddenly it got went of and one more thing this one plus tv for this they guys have provided customer care number on that number nobody will reply till you call them for continuously for hour i want my money back please help and i request amazon to take my this feedback seriously and band this one plus tv from selling i am going to put this detail feedback on all my socialmeadia connectionone plus tv are the most pathetic tv i have ever purchased picture quality is awesome when compared with other tv in the market with similar price range but the tv operation is slow after months of use i use prime hotstar netflix switching between app and sometimes selecting movie is also slow worst part is you can not turn on the tv simple in a push of a button sometimes you have to do tricks to turn on the tv happy with the sound and picture quality please improve the above issues tv seems to be very good for the price after days but service from amazon is pathetic for fitting they sale tv on exchange takes away the old tv and delivers new one then they keep you waiting full day for tv fitting and when you call the service person he says he doesn t have time call center says they cam resolve only in hours so days you are left with no tv we were left with no choice but to fit it ourselves will never recommend anyone buy tv and trust amazon for installation and fitting services worst product ans worst installation waiting for installation from the last two weeks everytime installation was cancelled due to non availability of stand big big disappointment from oneplus today my oneplus tv installation was done and after installation people went then after that tv started flickering and after sec tv is auto shutting down i complained to amazon and now they are arranging repairing at my home as the product is under warranty oneplus tv in india has given its warranty repairing to amazon and there is no oneplus repairment center in india i had used oneplus maximum products and was fan but this tv has broken all the trust by seeing the cheap quality of tv worst quality from oneplus all are good but more lags and buggs some times picture stoping remort not working properly and the oneplus connect is operating but media option missing in that soo u can t see ur phone videos directly in phone please update and clear the buggs if you look closely my playstation is connected to the tv and this is what it looks like hands down the worst product you can buy hdmi keeps switching back to home on it s own and hats off to amazon india i had to sit down for mins for just to ask customer support to replace the product and the technician will come after days then it will go back which will take to days and then they will send a new one which will take another to days so i am stuck with a non working tv for nearly a week and i am not sure if the new one will work or not while my money is somewhere in a billionaire s account which is not even one percent of the total amount he has in his account thank you amazonthank you one plusso my opinion if you should buy this tv is take your money and give it some homeless people at least you will have done a good deed sorry about the rant poorest post sales services amazon denied and asked to contact one plus at your local area and authorised oneplus service centres too denied that we don t take television complaints what a customer will do at last television in dustbin in less than one year don t buy electronic goods from amazon don t buy this tv pathetic quality of product as well as their customer support within months it s display panel become dead and nothing can be seen by complaining about the product i came to know that they don t have another display panel of this model to repair it they even don t have the fresh unit to replace it s been a month but they couldn t help me out very poor quality of product and shameful customer support worst tv i had ever seen in my life its turn into black and white tv after using days and many more problems with its i had requested for repair in september and still waiting for repair its more then three months and its shows waiting for parts ever i called many times to oneplus customer care regarding this and they provide only new dates not solution totally fed up with oneplus service never purchase oneplus tv its my request to u all it is an avg product almost or i must say exactly similar to mi no way near to the one plus experience buy mi or one plus y series features os everything is same samsung sony lg users can easily feel the huuuge difference so far working good but sometime tv do not switch on with single click from remote os is slow and quite a lot of apps does not work like voot using its chromecast functionality to play shows from non working apps all in all avg product good for temporary use i was little bit confused with respect of price but i chosen brand over the price and i found the best quality awesome picture great sound and very light which can be put up anywhere over the table or easily can be mounted on wall i got the product on next day morning of order i also had ordered dish tv which has been set next day delivery satisfied with amazon service thanks don t buy oneplus tv at all they might be good but their service is horrible i got my tv on st july however it got installed on th july but here the catch is not by oneplus technician but i have to spend money and book the installation by urban clap but amazon customer care said they will have the amount reimbursed worst service ever i bought a new tv from amazon it hardly worked for a month from then it has been dead in my house not turning on tried to book amazon waranty services atleast times and have been waiting more than a month but neither they are exchangeing nor they are changing the parts of tv finally i am going to report in consumer court becaus they don t care at all after sale bluetooth and wifi didn t worked on this so called smart tv even pathetic amazon service they kept on suggesting tv inspection even after i confirmed that every normal check was done and tv was reset based upon suggestion from oneplus technical support after endless calls and days they agreed for replacement which was to be done in days while new tv was available next day i have instead retuned it and bought a sony tv got installed today everything seems perfect picture quality is good sound quality is nice not big but nice maybe when in summer coolers will run there can be some problem in hearing but that i can only confirm in summer smart features remote control is also very nice easy to use voice command feature i was still not able to use as i did not get much time with led youtube prime video are working fine picture quality is good but sound quality worst and build quality also not so much good the best android tv in this price range especially the picture quality is the best sound is not that great but if you have dth connection which provides dolby sound like tata sky then this tv dolby feature works very well all other options are almost the same in all andriod tv series and an extra feature is after updating the software there is a app called oxygen play which automatically saves data of our viewing content from different ott platforms and helps us to resume whenever we want to continue watching display wise it s the best pricing wise it is goodpicture quality is goodbut they using normal grade panellight weightsound level is low when compared to other smart tv segments in this price range like other brands mi realme vubluetooth wifi is the best featureswall mount should buy separatelyeven official oneplus wall mount is not available in online technician provides other brandthat is higher price than the oneplus approx if the right availability in oneplus brand that priced at only but bad luck it s not availableoverally speaker volume must be important to improve in upcoming oneplus tv susing a good grade panel gives lot more quality i think my schedule of my installation ws on may bt nobody came also nobody call me today on wn i call amazon they the person who ws on call otherside shows that they dnt hv any respect to customers he says person fr installation will came on total days delayed bt they dnt fell sorry fr this they say that if i open box warranty will go i will nt gt warrantythis ws gift fr smone it birthday ws on may i will hv to wait till may to see if tr is tv inside or something alse installation team did not show up on scheduled day had to keep calling to get the installation done mount was not provided for if charged mount for costs but the installation boy charged us for it installation agent was very rude arrogant and unprofessional wasnt ready to give us a reciept for the extra amount when asked service was the worstest from oneplus the tv got problem with the motherboard and for the repair service i was still waiting from august th more than months still waiting nothing happened everything was ok with the tv but never expect any service from oneplus customer support or oneplus when you call oneplus customer support you have to wait on the line for the whole day to get irresponsible answers from oneplus amazon will help you but i request please dont go for oneplus products worst customer support i have ever seen product is ok but one plus service is horrible yes i mean it its horrible i need some technical assistance as i m unable to connect my router with smart tv i requested couple of times to pay a visit and give demo unfortunately no one turned up till date giving lame excuses i m surprised if i have been treated like this within product warranty what i ll do after warranty exhausted one plus customer care is pathetic a major cause of concern please don t ignore this tv has couple of technical issue while mapping with other external device like lan bluetooth all pros excellent picture quality voice quality is good but needs go to settings and do setup to genre you watching i set it to sports for everything i bought it in annual sale and it is nice prodct under this price cons no bootup sound or beep when powered on or used remote so you have to press remote quite hard takes good minuts to boot up overall verdict satisfied with the picture quality and sound quality of product could use a notification sound to save my remote though amazon installation service is not great as they force you to purchase wall mount stand and charge the installation also the tv was delivered on time but it sat there over the weekend as the installation person could only come after days moreover they void your warranty if you go for diy installation or setup which is pretty easy to do strange from amazon picture and sound quality are good but occasional glitches with respect to frozen or slow response while content surfing this needs tv to be restarted to make it smooth again my mitv which is slightly cheaper works flawlessly in this aspect and oneplus has a lot to improve via software update maybe i wish i had read the review s on oneplus official facebook page people are complaining about the service providing by one plus now let me share what happens with me i bought this tv through amazon with amazon and one plus brand warranty now i am facing some issues with my tv i called the amazon service to fix my tv and i called them many many times and no one visit at my home to fix the tv to let you know i am living in delhi ncr not himalayas so when amazon is failed to do that they escalated my request to oneplus and now it s more than a month i am still calling them to fix my tv and every time they said we escalated your request to related department kindly wait for days to visit the technician and after days you called they again saying the same thing again and again it s really frustrating so i suggest don t go with one plus tv i was bit worried about the lag reported by some reviewers fortunately i did not face any problems the picture quality is very good sound is also good menu options work well except voice commands which i couldn t get running couldn t have asked for more at this price point highly recommended update got the voice recognition running great performance i am really afraid about purchasing the tv because of the negative reviews i have seenbut after i have bought the product i am so satisfied with it and i must not have bothered negative reviewsthe picture quality is good mines an sd connection it would be awesome with a hd connectionmany said the sound is bad but i don t see it like that because at of the sound everyone at my home in any room of the houseyou need the adjust the sound at sound settings for better sound with the dolby given the sound is fascinatingit is good budget tvbought it along with alexamine is a remote location but got the installation done right the next day after the item has been received the tv is very good the picture quality is outstanding for a tv in this price range the sound is pretty good if you select the right setting but the default audio settings produce terrible sound but you can t expect much more with a tv in this range i don t think you can find another tv with these qualities in this price range other than the samsung tvs i guess but trust me play a k video and you ll be mind blown by the picture quality and colours even though it isn t a k tv i bought this product and it s month passed tv accessories seems to have some malfunction technically we don t know for sure and technicians doesn t arrive at location to diagnose the actual reasons for the problem digicare reps won t call on your appointments timelines and kill your time and doesnt show up at location instead on various followups some un authorised person calls and make assumptions from the technical issues as per customer feed and they encourage you to buy a new accessories instead of actually checking the problem at the location my experience with this oneplus tv has been below average for the kind of picture quality sound system and bt connection isues and other features are not so fascinating i suggest fellow customers to buy another chepaer product with best installation and warranty claims but not this kind a item with such marketing strategies very worst tv i have ever seen worst kind of support from one plus recommend not to buy this one bought this one on dec after months of usage screen flickering issue occurred i try to claim warranty from one plus from march month till now raised many cases to one plus support team but there is no proper update every week they are telling new update now finally yesterday they said again like tech visit will be arranged from mar month i have received tech visit month once i am getting tech visit but no proper resolution given for my problem now i called with amazon team and asked them to support me now am going with amazon let me see whether one plus people take my concern now picture quality is quite amazing and i am fully satisfied with that picture quality gamma engine is one of the major plus point in this comming to remote control it is some what average even if we click on the buttons on the remote some times it will not function and sometimes when we we are watching channels in the set top box it abruptly comes back to home ui inteface not sure why it is happening may be it will be getting updates in further comming days now coming to sound i didn t like the sound much when we are watching any tv channels which are connected through set top box it s okay and when we are watching any movies in netflix or prime video sound is totally disaster even we can t hear the dialogues clearly this is one thing that i was disappointed a lot now i must plan to buy a sound bar if the tv sound quality is good i may not buy this this is the thing that oneplus must definitely look into it if you want good picture quality and you previously have a speaker sound bar then you can blindly go to this if you are not having any of the sound bars speakers the choice will be of your own hi i have bought this tv and it is good but the seller took for wall mount which i get it for in amazon so please purchase only the tv and wall mount separately it doesn t connect to my mbps g excitel netwrok it doesn t show it in the first place sound quality is very poor no base at all picture quality is not great system is very slow and laggy it lags a lot when i cast my phone i can t cast my laptop onto it even when i can it lags a lot and takes whole eternity my suggestion would be to not go for this model instead buy something else like for eg tcl after months of usage tv panel stopped working on lodging compaint its been more than days one plus service partners is unable to tell that how long will it take to replace tv panel dont buy this tv the media could not be loaded seems all the review videos on youtube and all the reviews were paid for this tv pathetic performance not even complete months and all the smart features of the tv stopped working calling one plus tv customer care but no body helped with any visit or technical support online the picture quality sound connectivity issues were already bad but we ignored them initially but now it just stopped working and all we have a normal led tv without remote and without any smart feature i don t know if this review will help me too but i just wanna warn people planning to buy this please don t i purchased it through amazon on on st i went to my native for days and returned on th the tv was performing good till then on th nov from night pm there occurred a picture problem and half of the screen went black and other half went pink i am regularly calling oneplus customer care but is yet to get a satisfactory answer if they don t replace my product with a new one am going to place a consumer case registered against them don t believe in this product go for samsung and lg instead i ve been using this tv for weeks now and i ve only used it with my wifi connection i ll be brief in my review for the amount you are spending you will not be disappointed picture quality is good but at this price point if you compare with tvs at a higher price point you will be surely disappointed colours are bright but could have been better sound quality could certainly have been better don t try to raise the volume too high or else the sound will break it is acceptable if you have a average size room say x but anything larger than that and you will feel the inadequacies there is a certain noticeable lag in operation but nothing you can t live with and you also get used to it again i will say that the amount which you are spending it serves the purpose there are other brand tvs also at similar price but this was the latest model and hence i purchased it i m satisfied giving stars and i don t think that you can get a star rating tv in this cost to start with the weight is definitely light hence easy to install on a wall good decent picture quality for the money one spends on it can t expect clarity like expensive one on this now the down sides of this android tv the sound quality is bad dialogues can t be heard sometimes and you really have to crank up the volume to an irritable level remote is definitely not the most responsive of the lot each button needs to be pressed couple of times while pointing at the right direction for it to work speak function is worst absolutely non usablebuy only if you use your television seldomly plz help regarding my tv one plus y series i need replacement becoz tv have issue in hdmi port pictures are flipping and one plus doesn t have parts waiting from last weeks while i ordered recently this one new tvit get resolved and fully appreciated the media could not be loaded guys this was by far the best purchase i have made my wife is a plus fanatic so i purchased this thinking it won t be that good to my surprise the out put till now has been amazing there is slowness here and there while updating but that s normal for this price this tv does not disappoint premium look and premium quality the media could not be loaded don t buy this tv worst experience bought it only months back when it was launched but now the screen display is flickering and stuttering the oneplus service team is so poor that they could not even respond properly oneplus may be a good brand for high end mobiles but not for any other consumer goods i just want some technician to arrive at my place to sort the issue out no one is responding properly service team sets a bad example for oneplus oneplus service team is not like for samsung or any other big brands their network is so small that they can t provide the service on time and in many areas tv is good light weight and easy to use it is so light that i have to go to the warehouse to pick that up because the delivery person says he can t come to deliver and he was okay if i complain i got the tv after almost days when it had reached the warehouse and the best part the delivery team were not even concerned about it i just walked in after so much frustration and picked the tv and then i got a msg on my phone saying your order is out for delivery i hope amazon does take some action tv is ok for use don t expect too much from oneplus i expected a lot more from tv like oneplus phones pros good picture quality not better software is user friendly connectivy is fast responsive remote st time faced lag after updated it solved cons low sound response of voice command is a lit more lag viewing experience is not as good view get better quality but in showing a shadow tv mirroring is difficult this tv has really really by the picture quality the grey uniformity of the screen is really very bad even worse than a lot of much cheaper tvs the viewing angles are also the worst i have ever seen in a tv the sound is very very bad and i wouldn t recommend this tv to anyone despite the android tv advantage this tv is much worse compared to tv which cost half of this i ordered new tv considering my old tv would be exchanged but delivery guys rejected it on ground that there are some marks on screen my question why would i exchange new tv from amazon when the reason for which i ordered was not satisfied advise stop cheating people on name of exchange as your guys will come and request pls pay the difference amount and take the products etc no point in going for exchange i could have gone without ordering a new tv with my older lg which is working fine till now exchange is tactic to fool customers in past also same has happened with mobile also at that time i rejected the order but this time i was trapped due to presence of family and kids wall mount was not provided by technician during installation since they did not have stock and now i m asked to pay for wall mount brackets isn t this something that will be provided by technician during installation for trying to adjust for technician request for handing the wall mounting bracket later i ve to pay extra price this isn t something expected from amazon i buy one plus tv with high expectations but not good picture and sound quality good one plus led tv hdmi not working last month no service centre no response for one plus tv any service person come he tell just u r hdmi port not working wecannot handle and we cannot repair last month i cannot seeing my entertainment my suggestion pls think and buy money not come easy please bhiayon dhyan de mere sath dhokha huya hai mujhe nahi pata tha ki ismain screen monitering nahi ho pati hai yadi koi bolta hai to wo sirf jhuth bol raha hai iske liye ghar main do phone hona jaruri hai or phone main internet bhi hona chahiye nahi to connect nahi hoga miracasting not connecting easyly screen monitoring connection very poorproduct feture not acceptable this item i have been an one plus fan since i got the one plus t upon a lot of convincing my dad finally trusted a one plus tv as he is traditionally a fan of samsung panasonic and other established tv s the one plus tv not only has impressed him but the prompt installation and customer support has helped increase his faith in an otherwise new company coming to the tv the picture quality is amazing and the voice recognition along with alexa works like a charm despite many negative reviews on the sound quality i found it satisfactory and absolutely upto the mark i dont need any external speakers as the sound quality is damn good coupled with a good high speed wifi this tv is a steal at this price other smart led tv s are k expensive and with no other notable increase in any features as i have seen in many of my friends homes oneplus has done a commendable job with this product great picture quality with good sound best in its segment don t go for youtube reviews i think that s the drama made by the youtubers on reviewing this product this product has nice built quality as well only thing is you need to update its firmware when you connect to internet for the first time because picture quality is not as good as after update the media could not be loaded it is completely budget tv picture quality goodaudio quality poorremote and voice recognize averagethere is no audio output for old home theatresbuild quality not that greatno wallmount we need to pay extra rs while installing worst wall mount it is not slim tvpathetic installation service first of all i was in dilema that tv will in good condition or not but than i purchased it and its out of the expectation deleivery was fast installation was on time and cool features and also its pocket friendly product overall experience its an awesome star thums up i purchased tv but in a month when i connected amazon fire stick i realized the arc hdmi port was not functioning i filed complaint to oneplus first and amazon then the technician never visited my home after his only first visit in nov always made false reporting always rescheduling and cancelling visit appointments and even after then just updating waiting for parts i thank amazon who accepted return of my television in january and till th march he was making false reporting ultimately i told him about my return of television and he ended the service i have to surrender a good television just a small defect because of the pathetic service later i purchased hisense a f from flipkart with years complete protection plan of flipkart my oneplus tv also had a extended warranty protection policy i changed tv brand and purchase app just because of this service i hope this feedback will take some measures which will benefit your future customers oneplus is a brand what i know it gives premium quality product but in this y series tv of inches its not upto the mark i will rate by its performance product it good but performance is not upto the mark if i compare to mi tv as in same segment infact its performance is comparatively more better than oneplus tv issues what i am facing when you will power on the tv first it shows blue screen for seconds i don t kniw why performance is low it tooks overall second to start completely while give indication to power on by your remote you will not to know is it actually on or off because it takes around second to show response if you are restless person then this tv is not for you i recomend personal but all these software kind of issue it may be resolved over updated maybe but for now i dont want to go with this oneplus y series tv i am not percent satisfied or next its your call whether you want to go with this product or not oneplus is a good brand but this y series may bring it down good panel damaged within months of purchase less than hour of daily use on average the company doesn t have spare parts available have been asked to wait months for panel replacement better off buying vu tv much better picture quality reliability and service availability tv got delivered in good condition and installation went wellcoming to the tv picture quality it s awesome got all ott applications had a problem with oneplus connect app connecting to tvi have seen many complaining about sound but in my opinion its crazy i want to tell u guys thing if you want theatre experience go to theatre its a tv not a sound system so stop complaining about sound at last go for it dont change your mind on other companies and waste timeas these r my early days ill update abt the tv again after a monthupdatesound and picture quality are crazyoneplus connect app is laggyhaving issues with screen mirroring hoping for the update directly but i have no issue with screen mirroring from youtube prime applicationssupports rd party applications alsoas the ram is low it takes time to load apps once cache is formed apps open at good speedri now best tv in budget segment installation team took days after delivery it is bluetooth remote but sometimes it won t work we have to use it as ir remote tv is very slow to operate and apps crashes frequently connecting mobile remote is a hectic process even if you change color mode in tv it will work with default color settings while watching tv through av port poor panel quality the media could not be loaded i am writing this review after months of usepurchased on jan pros good picture quality color gamet is really working you can see vibrant color on screen fully satisfiedaudio audio is ok for one single room and ya ofcourse dolby sound is also working nicedesign bazzle less design will attracts attention while tv is on or off it looks very good like a modern smart tvcons vertical line on screen after months of use i got single vertical line on screen which is very disappointing for a brand one plus tv was ideal on wall and one day i saw a vertical line next day i got lines and now as you can see in the picture there are bold lines on the screen i have called to customer care and no response after week remote voice command is not working from very first day of installation but that was ok in front of screen fault you have to pay rs as a installation charge for inch tv writing this review after using it for a month i am using this as just smart tv not with any cable connection or dth service sharpness gets set to automatically out of no where and u will watch your tv playing everything in black white and once this happens tv never works the same as before picture quality is not so great tv gets hang in all the applications it ll go back to initial screen while you are watching something sometimes it works as radio you play some video but u can only hear it and entire screen will become blank amazon warranty claim service is pathetic i ve raised a request and waited for days still no technician had visited from oneplus to provide service and amazon doesn t have any information regarding that simply they offer this service as per the scheduled installation date technician not reported after days also it s not done finally we have arranged technician from local area fixed it fast delivery sound picture quality good price ok service no service team in odissa after receive the material we wait for install it week but nobody reached for installation finaly arranged technician from out side fixed itwe never expect that the poor service from amazon team please don t buy this scrap product i came to know i wasted after days of usage if you buy this definalty you will loose piece of mind sad story starts now i am writing review after days of usage product got delivered on th feb and installation is done on th feb days after delivery i can t able to use tv without wall mounting because of limitations at my home basic functionality display is lost after days of usage i could not able to return because of return policy of days of delivery return button is disabled initially i thought it was setup box problem that after troubleshooting i came to conclusion that it was tv display problem sad story continues i raised a complaint to amazon th march they told that they will send a technician to check problem and scheduled appointment is on march now i have wait for days to technician to come and inspect brand value of oneplus in mobile category is good when it comes to tv oneplus made a scarp product if basic functionality display is not working as expected its brand value is zero coming to amazon i didn t buy a product on road side platform didn t expect worst service from amazon for scrap product inspection after days after complaint sad story continues don t know if amazon will help me or not i had ordered this tv as a gift for my sister after days their is a black line appear on the screen and after some hour whole screen became black and nothing can be seen on the screen now we can only hear the sound with this tv because it happens after days so amazon refused to give us replacement and suggest us to contact with oneplus now oneplus taking its own time to decide whether they will give me a new replacement or they will repair this crap don t know how much time they will take we faced a lot of issue with the tv everything related to tv is good but the smart part really is disappointing we have to wait minutes before the tv turns on google assistant is not responsive most of the time not a smooth experience and just for reference my internet speed is mbps will recommend you all buy a normal tv and use amazon firestick instead firestick is smarter than the smart tv by one plus i love oneplus products and i hve a device bullets as wel tv all there products r too good n i will surely recommend all my frndz and family members to purchse tv dolbby version in tv has got a amazing audio effects i am proud to tell all my frndz dat am an oneplus user and own it never expected dat i would really feel so comfortable using tv also there z a very good quick response form customer service also itz easy to book a repair frm oneplus care app as world z becoming smarter even booking a repair z so simple by using user friendly app and the technician repairs it in front of our eyes which is really amazing and happy to tell woooow and a big salute to oneplus brand cheers manjunath rey the media could not be loaded purchase this during amazon sale for my room and it s an excellent tv have been using it for more than a month now and there have been not any issues such pros amazing clarity amazing sound for a small room chrome cast or casting works neatly all the apps work extremely fine the bluetooth remote is extremely good and there is a knack to use this it gets switched off due to inactivity so if you want to quickly turn on your tv you ll have to press on the power on button twice with a gap of to seconds in between cons there is a lag while starting the tv and some apps voice recognition take some time lags do happen because you re paying not a big price for a tv like this which is feature loaded so i feel this is worth the buy picture quality is bad may be some defect this is an android tv in budget it s total value for money not to best as compair with sony but in this price the product is worth sound quality is not so good but picture quality smart features are very good appears to be bad product and service within months time my tv stopped working led panel stopped illuminating called many times for product service technition came but no solution or response again made service request but since days nobody is attending my complaint poor service from amazon and one plus despite the product is under warranty premium look awesome picture quality unable to connect echo dot remote is also looking nice but main thing is that processing speed is slow sometimes sony liv and zee app stuck rest given chromecast and mobile share for oneplus is nice facilities guys sound quality is not upto the mark rest in this price this okay good the offer features looks and price of the oneplus tv is so tempting you simply can t resist buying but once you buy it after a month the problems start it won t switch on easily or will switch off like an app shuts down on your phone it s difficult to get your money back as obviously you can t exchange it for another brand the media could not be loaded delivery speed was great poor is an understatement for the quality of the product it is slow hangs every mins only way to get around it is to switch off and reboot speakers are pretty average above all watch the attached video the video gets stuck and a cracking noise plays reported and scheduled a return within hours from the time of delivery after using onplus phone i was extremely impressed and ordered the tv based on my experience after reading all the reviews here i feel onplus should simply take this product off the shelves if they care about their brand value th may return scheduled on th may no news yet on the pickup money will be refunded only after they receive the product th may i called and amazon promised to initiate advance refund if the product is not collected within hours th may i called amazon customer service is now saying that they cannot process advance refund until they recieve the product this is un ethical customer service from amazon they lie to the customers display gone within one month begging service engineer since a week after raising a request in oneplus service portal i know it s service teams negligence but problem is oneplus is least bothered to resolve customer issues i have purchased the tv along with echo dot th generation i was trying to add oneplus skill in alex but tv was not getting discovered i have called to oneplus support for the assistance but got mind blowing answer saying that due to some technical issue they have stopped the alexa support and may be released in coming updated amazon and oneplus both are fooling the customers by selling the incompatibility device with wrong advertisement after the issue with alexa i have observed one more issue i was not able to use internet even after my internet was working good after going through multiple blogs i found that there is some date and time issue i have again raised the complaint with oneplus support engineer visited and made factory reset and left i have called engineer the issue is not resolved the engineer has closed the service request saying that there is a problem with motherboard please raise the request again i have raised again with engineers feedback and support team has said that they have escalated the issue to manager and will receive the call back in hrs i have waited for week and again called up same thing they said you will receive the call back in hrs and this time i have waited around weeks and called to support for status surprisingly they have closed the issue without resolution asked the support person with what comment they have closed but he was hiding something and said that i don t have access again new issue request raised again in short please don t buy one plus tv s and don t fall for wrong advertisements of amazon and one plus these people are making the customers fools with name of brandregards mahender even if you don t budgeted for oneplus tv if your price is k different kindly go for this picture clarity and sound system is good great experience after lot if study and physical comparison in the showrooms has concluded in oneplus if you ask me or i ll say is the best installation done as per your request using the tv th month faulty product picture quality of tv is primary requirement which is quite bad as the angle of viewing slightly changed colour got faded technician comes with predetermined mindset doesn t want to understand issue by default product is faulty replaced once but quality of picture is still faded thanks to amazon that item returned and process for refund never experienced like this from oneplus product earlier as i am fan and mad about the brand but this product proved that oneplus is also doing the same gimmicks like others slowly loosing their never settle tag worst packaging damaged box completely wet on wet tv has a lag will not response to the remote and even crashes and freezes sometime light bleed from the frame dark patches on the screen if your ceiling fan is running forget about the tv output sound worst output hard to hear worst amazon customer service no technical knowledge and always demand for pictures and disconnect the call amazon declined to replace and offered refund of as against k which i paid for the tv after waiting for days and even brought pre book deal from acko and cashback and alexa customer service simply says product is not available for replacement cancel and take refund of never thought of writing a negative feedback on oneplus brand is loosing its value i will strongly say worst product from oneplus and worst service from amazon amazon delivery very fast received next day but installation is cumbersome the technician neither called me or came for installation on the scheduled day when i called him he will send someone for installation i am watching the tv on table stand only drawback of the product is lag in every step picture quality is marvelous but sound quality is not clear and upto the mark considering the cost the product is perfect after reviewed month i m sharing this details first impression is voice recognise is working very quickly and software updates got time when time of unboxing only very light weight and good sound speakers wi fi receives good singals strength and very fastly moving through remote operates android os is not bad using oneplus android app manage easily tv completely awesome this product cons using bluetooth headphone connected to tv sound is not good and something noise happening i m a big fan of oneplus products and i was so happy when they announced the tv y series i pre ordered it on the first day itself but later i ve realised that it was the biggest mistake the oneplus trademark of quality doesn t applicable on the this y series it feels like they have just put oneplus logo on some cheap quality tv i m getting regular issues with the tv if i claim for service the person comes and resets the tv and says everything it good and after days same issue happens st issue the screen went blank and only audio came without video nd issue video stuck and audio continues and remote doesn t work rd issue sometimes remote doesn t work th there is some little gap in between the outside panel and the screen and when i showed it to the service person he says it is normal due to sensors present that gap is visible but there is no sensor present in the middle th user interface sucks th bluetooth connectivity issue multiple times i reported and the service person comes and resets the tv and leave th connectivity b w tv and remote is the worst all the time the tv sucks do not go for it if you want a tv in the budget go for mi or realme oneplus y series is worst in the entire oneplus lineup picture quality is not good black is like brown and sound quality is very very poor i suggest you do not buy after installation and using one month i noticed that there is a problem with the android tv it s automatically turned off some time its hang no function is working i have to restart again if you re having a good budget then go ahead with the other brands this is my personal opinion but i find this tv is not reliable sir i have buyed it last few days in starting four to five days its working perfectly and now its gonna blur video quality and not happy with this product if company has send their executive to check it so its good otherwise it not a good and there is no customer support from this product also sir i m trying to cl again and again but there is not a good response from their side please pay attention regarding this and resolve this problem as the earliest screen problem disappears automatically sound problem not cleared wifi connection connection gone automatically nd shows no connectivity picture quality suddenly shows black nd white pictures i suggest don t buy it if u think it s one tv disappointed so much i brought this tv at the republic day sale and i regret taking this tv let me start with the good points about the tv the sleek and bazel less design user interface is pretty good pain points the installation experience has been pathetic and i in fact got it after a week of follow up and complaint raising the tv is terribly slow the booting of the tv takes a lot of time and screen to screen lag time is very high in the first week itself the google assistant stopped working and i raised further complaints the service guys then said that they will replace the remote but till now no further response the colour and contrast combinations are pretty bad the media could not be loaded full waste of money requesting everyone please do not buy one plus company tv after buy my tv within one month screen automatically damaged and it will repair by one plus next two months and there customer care executives are always give u a fake promise attachment video for your reference for buyers please read if you have already bought inch is the only best thing that you have got design splendidresolution youtube can t go above pperformance under fair not good i dont get it k k mobiles get better config why not tv another marketing gimmick i love watching videos more in my laptop and thought getting tv will be a great time pass despite pix resolution the youtube cant stream beyond p if you are looking for visual treat this is not it tvs reception from remote is awfull half the time i am trying to change volume or any other settings i have to closer to the tv the tv hangs so much while shifting from netflix to hotstar or any other channel after using oneplus mobiles for years i expected better from oneplus i am using nokia tv in same price range it is alot better great tv for the price been using it for two months now updates have seem to resolved some issues yet the tv freezing up sometimes still persist but on the contrary the picture quality is just amazing if you have a decent internet or a hd setup up box it ll support dolby audio i m happy with the tv picture quality sound quality and all the apps are great if your getting this for someone who can t use smart features don t worry you can set default input on power on and automatic power on when connected hdmi device is switched on there are few things to note you can t log in with your one plus account too much lag in screen mirroring oneplus connect screen mirroring is working only with oneplus smart phone screen cast work with all smart phones don t get confused with the k tv this one is not extremely slim thickness is same as any tv you can get below k very good tv picture clarity is superb sound quality isn t too good will need to add a sound bar alexa dot doesn t help in improving the sound quality instead using wireless bluetooth gives much better effect please do not go for this productpoor sound quality average picture quality very bad remote worst of the worst operating system despite of reporting all this issues related to software and sound quality none of the oneplus support team bother to call back and respond to the query its been a month now almost i have been following up with support team via email calls app twitter the only response i got is i will get back to you within hours but till today nobody has got back to me with any response the media could not be loaded actually i bought the on nov and i upgraded normal setop box to hd settopbox after days since i upgraded from normal to hdbox facing those issue screen flickering lagging those and all as i thought it would be becoz of weather problem as nirav is going and after few days facing the same issue and i kept service for settopbox they took the box for service and said there is nothing problem in the settop its becoz of tv problems facing of tv hdmi port screen flickering and lagging hdmi port no audio only videowhile we update apps on playstore its keeps on asking for agaian anad again chromecast lag its keeps on asking retrieving data when i plugin hdmi port since i kept for replace they are saying return or replace window closed on nov i am just one day delay i kept complaint on nov and they are saying contact onepluscare none of the one plus care agent contacted me and assisting me living with a fault tv its been we are not watching the tv veryy bad waste of money i think amazon could help me my concern is provide me a replace i brought the tv during amazon prime sale i have never expected such a cheap product from such a good brand tv lags all the time sometimes you have to press the on off button times to start the tv don t fall for the brand name and if you really care about your moneh stay away from oneplus tv it s been a week since i have been using oneplus tv inch here is my observation price i had a very good offer with my amex points and sale from amazon picture quality i would picture sound voice recognition weight it s just kg very lite and hence very delicate boot process i felt bit slow but manageable for an android tv amazing amazon delivery and very quick installation it appears for now a pretty smart buy for me i would have given zero stars if that was an option worst dealer i had my first tv replaced since the same stopped functioning after just a day when i got the replacement that too faltered to deceive there was no display at all if amazon ties up with such kind of dealers it is to their own peril the prodyct may be a good one becuase i haven t watched it even for one whole day but worst dealer and worst experience ever on amazon please don t buy anything from this dealer he may be pushing some used faulty pieces into market request amazon to black this dealer it s a good tv at this price picture quality is ok sound quality is pathetic for a tv inbuilt speakers are substanard and sound is breaking though they claim dolby there is no effect of dolby i have been using oneplus mobile for the past several years expecting same quality i purchased their tv also but got totally disappointed never expected such an experience from a reputed brand like oneplus the television we got on th of this month the installation team has not arrived to install my product and so i don t know the picture or sound or remote control quality the scheduled installation date was on th of september i ve called the amazon team thrice i got a number from the costomer care and i called several times through out the day s may be plus times once they attended the call and replied me that they will check and revert to me and then on no answering so i ll give this negative review i m really fed up with this product and since day s it s in the box and now i don t want the crapy product vere vere very bad from the amazon team if the installation team has any problem they should respond to me and i don t think even the amazon is taking proper action really bad no doubt picture quality is really good but this tv has some issues if you want a true review and complete details regarding cons then go and watch techiebeez india review of this tv on youtube best channel for tv reviews hardware specs are amazing for this product however the software is still in development so sometimes it may not feel polished and some lags when opening or installing apps reboots helps reduce the lags but until oneplus team manages better software you will be stuck with it the good news is this is android so you may be able to install a custom rom for more polished experience it s ok but not as good the sound is not good but picture quality is good and its operating system is bit slow i m purchase this tv march th delivered still running good but some times blootooth is not working properly and few days back automatically reset all settings but picture quality is superb and the television was delivered on time and installed by the team however from the very next day we realised an issue that did not connect the tv to the internet directly and had to be set everytime it was switched on months technicians on only response i hear is we are looking into absolutely disappointed with the service and product i can t connect bloototh tv from my mobile the google assistant does not work and the application oxygen play one plus connect does not work pls help me otherwise i returned the tv the media could not be loaded bought this tv on nd march and by th march i could find that half of the tv screen has got blurred you can refer the below screenshots march as soon as i found the issue i have scheduled an appointment with the digicare services and warranty the service was scheduled to rd march but the technician didn t show up and left my calls unattended march reached the amazon service centre and they assured me to get the issue fixed by the end of the day but they didn t show up too and now i m still waiting for the technician to resolve the issue march technician reached me and inspected the tv for any physical damages no damages found and he confirmed that this is due to defective screen of the one tv i ordered a oneplus tv inch but i got a different model no that alos i found after installation even installation team also not excale this issue then i request for the exchange after times of follow ups and days after we got replacement and again we are awaiting another days for installation person don t know when it will be install surprisingly i want to tell u till we can t check the model no of the tv once installation person will come then only we can get the clarity on this so frnds be careful while receiving the product compare with ur order details and delivery product excellent value for money product everything works great no issues at all till now ignore negative reviews you will not get such a good product in this amount i will probably buy the inch as well was excited about tv from oneplus and was eager to buy one bought the oneplus tv assuming that it would have certain quality standards this tv turned out to be a bad purchase within hours of watching the tv noticed black patches in white screen across the panel have attached the pic called up az customer care and they confirmed that this is an issue this was my worst tv buying experience pitchure quality was the worst never oneplus tv i bought this tv on a sale for k after applying bank discounts initially thought oneplus would not compromise on the quality part but then after seeing the quality of the picture and smart features i have to certainly change my mind the so called android device is too slow and sometimes it just gets hanged the quality of the picture is average and this was very disappointing from oneplus overall an okay type tv did not expected this from oneplus reviewed in india on th may size name inchesproblems with oneplus tv y observed in few hours of use pros picture quality is undoubtedly good sound is fine enough for a closed room cons lags too much some times restarts automatically while watching youtube screen and sound disappears for to secs power on and off is also tricky some time disconnects from wifi and reconnect by its ownmaybe in later updates they provide some fix for all these issues review after one week product performance is average picture quality is good but over all performce not as mi tv better go to mi memory is only gbbefore finishing installation update for gb was therein chromecast there is a delay in video with audiothere is slight delay in all the time being a hard core oneplus brand it very hard to digest the worst quality tv supplied by oneplus the producy delivered to me is a faulty one with defective display pannel it s only showing lack of quality assurance by the brand which is known for providing quality products within the reach of common people i hope oneplus will seriously listen to these issue in future and take all the steps to recitlfy the problems in their system after a week s analysis i have placed an order for the oneplus tv on amazon the delivery person was good enough to install and provided the demo with very much patience tv was working fine for that day the problem started the next day though my home wifi is connected to the tv it is not allowing youtube to play and not allowing my mobile casting i have restarted tv many times and in vain later i have complained to amazon and they arranged a technician to my home and he agreed that there is an issue with the tv and suggested having a replacement in just months of using that screen started to get some lines later in jus days it went completely blank seller is refusing to repair it in warrenty very poor service by the seller will update the review if amazon helps me resolve this issue when things like this happen you really lose faith in online purchasing of such items amazon delivery and product was excellent my last tv was ordered from flipkart and prior to that from reliance digital in both cases the technician was assigned within minutes post delivery here i had to wait for another day for installation which means i lost days technician called and told me that i will have to remove the old wall mountable bracket myself as if he does it that will waste his time i had to call my contractor as i did not have the tools luckily i was at home if my aged mother was alone she would panic never experienced such service in the past worst sound quality plus worst bluetooth plus worst chromecast plus lagging and hanging issue plus displays scan channel page without any reason good but some issues remote sensor is not good when connect with other device there is difference between audio video on off automatically sound quality is not good but how much we expect in the media could not be loaded i chosen the product keeping one plus mobile performance and reputation in mind but since the day the product delivered nothing matched with the quality there was a free installation service with the product cart but no one turned up till date sound quality and picture quality is not maching the compitition now hanging issue is increasing day by day don t know what is fate of this product ahead i am reviewing this one plus tv with various aspects after th day of usage picture quality picture quality is quite good because it is full hd the color in picture are very impressive sound it comes with watt dolby speakers very louder but not recommend to listen in full volumesmart features it comes with android with pre installed prime video netfix and youtube some time you tube crashes talked to customer care they said they are working on it in nutshell it is satisfactory with this price range bad tv don t go for it you ll regret to switch on this tv the remote given is useless not everytime you press the on button the tv will get switched on it depends on the mood of the remote it gets hanged also sometimes voice quality is ok sometimes it gets quiet inaudible i bought this tv on aug and it gets installed on aug and tv was not connecting to wifi at the time of installation i logged a service request for the same and the problem is still not resolved even after visits of technicians and more than days just fyi i live in delhi not any remote part of india showing no connection with buletooth and wifi devices poor built quality the technician from also came and he suggested to replace this unit but customer care executive give me another appointment of technician why the replacement or return of item is not available if the customer is not satisfied after investing money more than other brands this model of tv is not value for money after weeks remote is not working connectivity features also not good inbuilt browser also not available plz don t buy it vu tv is better than oneplus installation was not done and didn t respond worst service sometimes remote not working suddenly getting back from the apps its hardly months that i have purchased the tv and there are already few problems with the software when we press netflix it starts youtube sometimes the screen automatically blacks out while watching the tv seems one should always buys reputed brands only not worth buying even at lower prices waiting to see how they provide the after sales as its under warranty just didn t like the product as it is not working properly this is the first time that i am really disappointed by amazon and one plus but one time is enough from now onwards amazon will be the last resort to buy the things as well try to buy from showrooms or flipkart if something won t be available somewhere then only will do business with amazon after being a loyal customer for years never expected that amazon will treat me like this thanks for screwing up things bought this product last year in july from the start it had picture quality issues and the tv was very slow and laggy in the first months spots developed on the tv which resultef in changing the entire display for a new one and now i m having problems with the startup of the television it is just showing the logo of plus and then switching off didn t expect such a product from a trusted brand like oneplus the main problem with it is not its speakers but the software support being given its software is very laggy and buggy with bugs which are never fixed it might receive software updates but the bugs are still there every time if you turn the tv off with remote it turns on again on its own sometimes you have to press the power button several times to turn it on if you switch between apps extensively it gets slowed down and lags till you restart it takes several seconds to power on overall it has bad speakers and bad software display is good but you have to tweak it a bit because it is so saturated so spend some more money and don t buy this product did not expect from one plus worst experience ever all of sudden video went into black and white and also one black lane was observed on the screen technician came and concluded that both back pannel and display got spolied i raised a complaint and fighting with customer care almost months and exchanging the mails lot of drama happened finally they replaced the new tv hope it goes few months can t suggest you to buy this tv please think twice before you are going to buy writing the reviews after months of usage tv on off with the remote doesn t happen in one shot tv gets crashed often for tha last days tv has become black and white i have raised a compliant for which there is no proper response and they are not ready to provide replacement as well need help from amazon with in month wi fi is not working tv restarting again and again service request logged on april but still no one is attending this call one false technician was allotted for this call but when i call to technician he told that is not working with this company from last month i had mailed to one plus customer care but nothing happed till date absolutly stunning oneplus did a great job picture quality awesome imersive sound is literallty more than enough for a large hall bass sourround sound loudness and quality is just great if you turn the volm to max you are going to feel as if a large saadi wala dj is in your room google assitant blutooh pairing screen cast all installed apps works seamlessly no laging issues at all bezels are extremely thin if you watch tv from a distance you cant say even tv has bezels or not build quality is just great tv is very light weight one word review best value for money literally the media could not be loaded first product receive there was a line coming in the screen so tried for replacement installation took three days tried for a replacement and again wait for week to deliver product deliver now waiting for installation days already passed dont buy from amazon they have worse installation facility and also they will take very much time instead go for sony it is best instead of mi one plus or lg remote is not working faster if you use frequently performance is good even it has a good clarity i m giving it stars cuz of the poor service i have been complaining since one month after the purchase of the product it still has an issue with wi fi connectivity as well as bluetooth connectivity it started just after a month of purchase and i have complained it for time even still there is no response at all now it even has an issue with ethernet cable ie even after connecting ethernet cable it s showing as no internet it has such a poor customer service worst must prefer offline lot of hectic procedure also display was faculty picture gets blur anytime and it s stuck for secs first of all one star for amazon not for tv from buying to installation every thing is pathetic first if you want to buy this item u should have prime membership first condition after becoming the prime member tv is delivered after seven days it s a joke from amazon and it shows that they don t take their prime members seriously and i have to wait for freaking days for insatallation then that insatallation guy really he is a fraud he charged me rupees for wall mount and before coming for installation he asked there is two wall mount one is local of rupees and another one is from one plus of rupees so i choose the one which is from one plus which is doubt full one plus should add wall mount barcket in the box so these fraud installation guy can t receive any one after amazon doesn t take the liability of this they said that this is the genuine price and i doubt it because he didn t bring the wall mount bracket in retail box and making excuse that he don t have enough space in his bag this is the first time i am buying anything from amazon and i buy disappointem not a tv from amazon again thanks amazon for this shipment experience now for tv is ok picture quality is decent but sound is not that great it s loud but not clear it could have been better connectivity is good just like everyone is saying that tv lags not in my case remote work superb no lags and everything else is ok bad product no value for money i have bought the tv on oct on amazon great indian festival sale and my honest comment is slowness while using android and chromecast poor audio quality when wifi is switched on then tv automatically off and change from cable or antenna to android so again we have to use the tv remote and change it back to cable youtube crashed some time so we have to switch off and switch on it again good product panel quality and sound is good for the price it is worth smart functions can be bit overwhelming for some but overall good experience android tv options are good even though youtube may take but time to load and search still highly recommend with my days only use the panel just went kaput one fine day fortunately during warranty period amazon took ages to even respond even escalation was handled poorly every amazon agent only after getting good ratings without any useful action brand responded in two days to depute a service person more than a week later one plus says they do not have replacement parts in stock and do not even know when they will be available typical chinese product buy at your own risk in their association even amazon has got spoilt in this product one plus android led it is having problem when you see picture from other angle instead of straight and it is not possible your all members can sit only infront of screen straight position only when you will sit lightly side or side angle then colour will see fade same problem was in previous piece and i replaced this and new piece delivered on april but same problem in this i will recommend to all never buy this product because this is a manufacturer defect and will lodge the compliant in my warranty may be amazon will help for correcting this brought a tv it worked for days and then the tv dsnt wana turn on never expected this kind of thing from one plus very poor also the best part is they have many complaints like that coming for this model its so evident that knew there is some issue with this model of product and its still its out for sale and now i am being waiting for a tech to visit me from days guys this is for any one who is buying this particular product plese please think twice i dnt knw anything abt other product though this model of tv has some problems not worth the humiliation and tension have been using oneplus tv for more than months now excellent purchase good picture quality good audio output great features since its android you can install apps from built in google playstore app in the tv i use an iphone no issues while casting mobile to tv screen the only thing i dislike is that it sometimes glitches while switching between apps hope oneplus fixes it soon with updates an excellent tv in this price range go for it changing my review after months firstly it does not start normally as you have to wait for a whilesecondly after it starts it goes to home screen by its ownalso poor display and sound quality cheap panel and its not oneplus brand quality moreover its remote stopped working now writing a review after months it s working absolutely fine picture quality is good and it s a perfect buy in the price i tried to connect on g but didn t happen but g also works great so i didn t bother to call the technician installation was quick and paid only for wall mounting which was around the system hangs and gets turned off itself i am tired of complaining about the product and have filed the complain thrice and there is no response from the service team they have disappointed and ruined my experience from buying the product from amazon and one plus products i am never going to recommend one plus products anymore to anyone on the first visit technician asked to visit make a video when it gets turned and talked with inappropriate manner it s my third complaint so far and they have ruined my experience few functions are not working had so much expectation from one plus like brand please explore more option before buying yhis tv with in one month all hdmi ports stopped working remote sensor is at right bottom of tv so everytym tym u want to operate using remote u have to point ur remote there this is painful sound quality is ok but volume is less oneplus software is ok decent but it is little laggy overall for this price it is ok but there are quite some issues which needs to be fixed in this tv i would say avg product not so great not so bad either yes the tv is too goodpositive good picture clarity power saving cheap price chromecastnegative very delicate body suitable for wall mount and preferred for table mount no sound clarity remote is not accurate and provide a good quality remote never going to order anything from amazon terrible service tv stopped working within days and asked for support the support didnt show up and it said service completed and now it says service not available we are unable to watch the tv from months amazon didnt give any support from months customer care keep on saying they will fix in days but dont do anything tried amazon for the first time and was terribly disappointed dont buy this go use flipkart never using amazon ever within months we booked customer service times and facing issues frequently after months it was automatically restarting and not connected with wifi then customer service fixed that again after months it was not connected with wifi and not sync with remote if we call the customer service it will take business days to visit our home very bad experience i was skeptical at first because of the negative reviews regarding the sound quality but after tinkering with a few settings i managed to increase the volume the tv has amazing picture quality and sound quality is way better the previous tv i owned first product had wifi connection problem i had to connect to mobile hotspot first before connection to home wifi is established technician told me to replace item the replaced product also had wifi issue tv time needed to be set correctly every time tv is started oneplus technician told there is software issue and they are waiting for next update i can t rely on that returned second item as well i m getting some other brand now otherwise tv seemed fine when i was able to play it the media could not be loaded the product seems like something picked from a chinese container and stamped with you oneplus branding the wlan doesn t work in the tv and even after numerous attempts haven t been able to the amazon installation team seems they are so uneducated about the product that they are not able to understand the problem or maybe they don t want to poor product from the oneplus saddle after a month of usage switch on tv takes seconds post pressing power button over remote clear indication or lag while using dth have to use remotes oneplus tv remote to switch on off increase decrease volume and airtel dth remote don t know if it s how the oneplus tv remote is designed that it won t sync with airtel dth remote or something else sometimes there s no sound while tv is switched on while on dth to fix it i restart tv and it works not sure if it s the software issue for live tv or issue with dth set top box configuration i bought this for my bedroom for this price its ok finishing of the tv is bad the edges look odd picture quality is good sound is definitely not good its loud but not good tv got delivered within days and was installed at the time of delivery i ordered the tv it s a good tv at this price range after receiving the tv amazon is unable to install it because of their technical problem i wait for some days for their suggestion but they failed to provide me support that s why i returned it this tv also not working with alexa amazon provide wrong information both tv i have both tv not working with alexa i request to amazone please don t provide wrong time i called customer care they also not provide any solution regarding this issue time they sent technician and they also faild to connect alexa with tv and the major thing is technician don t knw how to connect alexa both time they came and check only tv the product received was in good condition amazon delivery is awesome but the performance of the tv is not satisfactory i am facing a technical issue with the television the colours are too bright for a normal eye the remote television connection is bad takes a long time to switch on off change the channels i am not sure if the customer care even exist for one plus y series tried reaching them twice but no luck the first time they closed the request stating i was not reachable second time no call so far not sure if it s me who is facing the issue or if anyone else please do highlight my suggestion do not go for this brand when you the likes or sony and lg and others delivered and installed on saturday october th it was working fine on that day second day morning when switched on the entire display turned into pink and it happened on the third day as well had to switch off and then switch on the tv again to make it work properly everytime didn t expect this for a k tv and from oneplus do consider before buying this have requested for a inspection and replacement let s see how amazon deal with this issue overall the bestbut being a one plus useri have to tell that the size of product is a little less than inches and speaker quality is great but while using netflix we have to increase the volume above pros good picture qualitysatisfactory sound qualityuser interfacecons no g wifi band connectionlags in user interfacemost of all pathetic after sales servicehaving mentioned all that god forbid if your device needs a repair amazon and oneplus will take forever to resolve that even if your device is in warrenty and requires a part change you will have to wait for months to get it resolved the media could not be loaded i bought this product months back but the display became faulty don t buy this product diaplay very impressive sound ultimately clarity no need external speaker for home its more enough connectivity easy to connect to internet access through one plus app to tv value for money one thing i recommended to buy dth hd connection this is for my one week experience useless product if you re remote conks then no replacement available even if you want to pay and buy oneplus keeps saying that they don t have it in stock so buy at your own risk the media could not be loaded the tv is overall perfect picture quality and sound the only question over here is of reliability i bought this tv on september but facing problems with it since then and when i raise a complaint it starts working fine automatically and magically it occurs again after month faced the issue again last week and this time the issue still existed when the service person came please see the video attached and decide this video was taken by the service technician that visited overall i rate this tv star because if reliability dont buy this tm if you are looking for good display i connected this to my laptop and the quality of the display is so bad you can clearly see pixel and it is blurr its only good for sound and app feature not for display tv not working from day two onward contacted one plus through amazon for service no res ponce from company side and amazon side also finally they cancelled service requesttv with me but not working waste of moneydon t buy i had a lot of expectations but iam disappointed the picture and sound quality is good but the software is very very very bad maybe because it s just gb ram it s gets stuck intermittently it gets shutdown on its own it keeps coming out of the apps like youtube on its own tv display is damaged in day i can understand in machinary it happen but after one month brand is not repair it this is the concern i have reached to amazon they also not helped and say we are not responsible brand will give resolution on this i am waiting waiting and waiting when techinician will can and repair if it will not resolved in next days then last option is consumer court remote is not working properlypoor picture qualityworst soundan entry level tv where you don t mind quality never expected worst product form company like one plus do not buy this product as it s quality is worst there are bugs small insects ants entering into the display and roaming freely inside it please see the picture i attached with this review i am trying to contact customer care for last days but no reply from their side as well i feel like i have wasted on this product worst ever after days of purchase tv is not starting raised issue in amazon and they denied service raised to they are also making excuses since complaint raised still counting days and no one has shoen up till now more than a month passed since complaint raised picture quality was goodsoftware running smoothlylike it very muchbut within a day display started problems like flickering white may be i got defective product i think so i returned it i bought the tv on october and intalled on th october but on december th the tv showed display error and i requested a service via amazon but literally there was no response form them for these three days it has everything to offer in this price range but the only issue i see in the device is it is slow something that i can t even change the application or go back to the menu again but that occurs like or times a day other than that i guess its a very nice product in this price range tv was very good in terms of picture quality sound is manageable to some extent internal featutes and wifi everything works pretty good in remote two of the buttons were not functioning but voice wise it is able to recognize but tv is quite lacking the media could not be loaded my opinion is to not buy this tv why because i have faced an issue with the wifi connection as it disconnects automatically as shown in the video i have changed it once under warranty but after a couple of weeks the issue still exists so go for mi or realme smart tvs oneplus is lacking in their quality and services if you have any other go to sell the product please go ahead and buy something useful two conditions faced in last days wifi connection in tv is not stable same wifi in other tv and devices won t give problem however in plus tv it keeps on disconnecting often shows home screen without pressing any button on remote while binging shows over internet good tv was not what was shown in the description whole plastic body was looking very cheap besides the rate was also cheap but at first i thought one plus would not deliver cheap product even at cheap price but i was proved wrong i returned the tv as there was some technical issue where tv was showing blue screen when turned on after few hours in standby mode and only solution was to turn it off completely and then again turn on so finally i decided to get rid of the tv and as there was no replacement available i got a refund writing this review after months don t buy this tv the quality for display is very poor i m using oneplus and vu tvs when comparing with oneplus vu tv s display quality is far far better and i got bright and dark spots in display after months of usage i ve called for service it is more than a week but no response from the service team there are still asking for more time better go for vu don t bought this onle plus tv some features are not working mobile mirror voice assistance so i have sent replace request after that replacement i got defect damage product refer enclosed pic now a days amzon selling worst product i am experience few products recently i ordered this during the festival sale this product was delivered and installed on time coming to the product the hdmi ports were not working properly one port wasn t working at all and i was seeing a pinkish screen on the other port amazon didn t let me replace the tv and i had to reorder the tv at higher price than before the new tv was delivered after more than days and the installation date provide was one week after that so for getting a working tv i had to wait for days the service provided by amazon during this festival sale was no where near the mark set up by them previously product was very good but had worst blasting speakers one plus does not have good customer service for tv since it was manufacturing defect amazon took return else one plus customer service was non existent learnt a big lesson better to spend k more and go for samsung poor quality tv at low cost poor display poor sound quality extremely slow procesor you can not see the tv for long time not a eye friendly delivered with damage display returned the same amazon should stop selling poor quality product to maintain their quality standard oneplus has rolled out a perfect tv like it s phones good picture quality display ui and remote direct option to switch to youtube netflix primevideo the google assistant works perfectlyneed bit improvement in sound quality best pacy in least price it is one plus no need to write anything picture quality is good everything is good it comes with android you will never get this type of product in this prise tag i m making this statement after through market research but internal video player could be better it never resumes your playback overall im fully satisfied and happy with my decision picture quality is okayish no ghz connection support audio quality is so poor that you may want to return the tv back installation is poorly done by rd party service costs for wall mounting i would suggest to add some more money and go for samsung sony or panasonic don t get tempted by price poor quality from oneplus didn t expected that from the starting itself i e from april it started showing problem with light and some time hanging problem now no picture is visible only sound please send service engineer to repair it immediately my overall experience with the product for days it s very bad tv is not working properly remote doesn t work and you can t do anything about it picture quality is very poor you won t get replacement from amazon shell out extra k and purchase from reputed brands never ever dream to go for oneplus be cautious you will not get any product support from amazon and you have to live with a defective product visit a nearby showroom and purchase from them this is what i wish to do right now after living with a defective product atleast you don t need to worry about after sales support the product is good but there are few bugs in oxygen play every time you have to pair bluetooth speaker to connect which is annoying you are in unpair pair device loop often the picture quality and perfomance is best in class the software experience is seamless i am expecting these minor bug fixes in software update one of the best lcd tv at this price range update on my after sales support it is the worst after sales support that i ever experienced compared to other brands during pandemic took almost months to get my panel replaced the tv is really impressive in all aspects haven t tried the voice recognition and other smart features because it has just arrived happy with the delivery within two days of placing the order butter service by the providers are pathetic the scheduled installation date was fixed but nobody came for the installation though i don t need installation etc but just wanted to know the service but i am really very disappointed with the service by the service providers this is the slowest tv i ever used don t waste your money pathetic display clarity remote functions are dead slow amazon refused to offer hdfc cash back contacted many times amazon agents are irresponsible and still it is pending really worst service from one plus i have purchased just months before it s always internet connectivity issue i logged a complaint days before but still issue not sorted still saying we will come and we will resolve really i was not expecting this kind of support from oneplus it has failed in television catagory this is the worst smart tv that would be available in the market with just netflix hotstar and youtube installed the tv hangs takes ages to switch from one app to another picture and sound quality is poor remote stops working and the tv needs to be restarted to pair the remote again i am using this tv since two weeks my honest review one of the best picture quality and good designed like premium looks i could see may reviews about sounds quality my personal experience is sound is so good it was clear and there is no any noise the one part i faced the issue is screen mirroring it was very bad i unable to connect screen mirror with one plus connect application i am connecting through party app into one month everuthing was working fine but now the hdmi port got compliant it take days for amazon to arrange technician to come after that its now days till now waiting for spare parts to come hope everything will be covered by warranty edit its nov th still tv is not repaired even amzon customer care people dnt knw what to do with this warranty please dont buy this tv i purchased the product last month in diwali sale and overall i am satisfied with the product quality but in comparison to the other brand s like mi realme etc price is on the little higher side if the rice is a little bit lower side it will be a higher selling product i m received this tv on th june today is rd july still the installation team didn t came i have only more days to make replace if any issues on my schedule date that technician called me asking for money for installation here they mentioned free of installation next schedule is showing for th june and that is the last date to replacing option for this tv try to change the process otherwise please stop your brand best in this price range we can expect morei am using since of july undoubtedly picture quality is too good sound is also good as compare to other brands there is an issue while opening any app i think it will get optimized after next update that they are providing in september i am a prime customer and usually order all my electronics and other stuff from amazon and i am happy with the services one plus y series was a nice deal but during the order there was no clear guidelines for amazon eco dot offer and i ordered as per the details mentioned there but i did not get eco dot and i contacted customer care but they were also not able to get me the offer i am a prime customer but disappointed with my experience with this order i have read the terms and conditions during that time and it was not present and later on added by seller or amazon the screen cast is not supported by the tv it s been months for the tv and the display started to flicker with a black line vertically on the display further the repair return service against the warranty is not very customer friendly i ve been trying to avail the warranty service but no positive response received from the other side better options are available this tv is called smart tv but cannot connect to g and can t mirror cast freely you will have to buy google chrome cast for the same will recommend don t buy smart tv from amazon at least coz the worst product and service anyone can get from amazon will be this within one month the product stopped working and not getting any help from amazon just pathetic service and faulty product i would suggest please dont but oneplus tv which is terrible in terms of usage i am using from the last months and it got repair issue twice and service takes uptown month to repair the tv worst product i have ever seen in my life please dont buy from amazon as well i never expected to write a negative review for oneplus product i love oneplus but i hate that tv because poor build quality white edges on bottom of tv and screen flickering is the most common problem half of the times tv doesn t start with a single button press booting takes atleast seconds screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time system lag is the maximum in this class of tv s echo dot doesnt work with the tv as advertised and is awaiting a software update so buying an echodot as a bundled offer with the one plus tv is not helping the tvs picture quality can be a bit better and really not upto the mark as it is advertised the tv apps is a bit slow and hangs at times the remote functioning is not as agile comparing a vu or any typical brand overall not a pleasant experience and not expected from one plus i have a feeling oneplus is compromising on the quality at various ends nice product at this price quality of picture is very nice has got all the smart features voice recognition is also good for that make sure your internet is has good singnal sound quality is not good for that you have to buy sound bar i am giving this review after a month as if now i have not got any issue yet but at this price i will recommend to buy oneplus tv gap between frame and screen disappointing sound quality is very bad build quality is very bad the media could not be loaded there is no doubt about picture quality it s one plus product just go for it after apple one plus is the only company has most trustable about quality and performance i am planning to buy another one on next sale picture quality is good issues with sound quality but on customizing the sound from settings the sound quality improves a lot at this price point it is quite good if one is happy using youtube amazonprime netflix which are pre installed you are not going to face any issues of lag most importantly found made in india written on the back panel of the tv so one can prefer this product from other available at same price range the media could not be loaded product is good but pictury quality is not as expected i feel mi smart tv picture quality is better than this oneplus tv my opinion because some people feel that oneplus tv picture quality is better than mi tv connectivity is good it runs android with built in playstore one of the best smart tvs out there it isn t k but no compromise in the picture quality whatsoever just a little bit slow but again at this price point and other features the remote is great and voice recognition and google assistant works great it can be ignorable also the sound quality is enough to fill a decent hall chromecast and pairing devices are really smooth i seriously recommend you not to purchase one plus products tv in days it got problem with blank screen and flickering from last months i am behind customer care and service centre guys no one till the day is responding and even after more than mails sent to support team oneplus is not supporting any tv which is purchased fron amazon as they said sound quality needs to be improved and you can use hd only less than tb which is major disadvantage any usb device more than tb will not work good installation team supportive helpful it has very great picture quality rich sound and all of the smart features available in present it also has support for voice assistants like alexa and google assistant you can assign commands through your voice the tv runs on android tv operating system so apart from regular content you can stream content directly from other online platforms like netflix amazon prime and youtube it is a china product material and voice is worst than kids toy it hangs after days worst support for claim support team only wasting time warraty repair request automitically finished without service i m going to wait for a week otherwise going to throw this into dustbintoday on decamazon person telling that service to be provided by company and company technician without any service without clearing claim finished the claim ridiculous i bought this product because all my family members have plus phones but was very disappointed with the remote control the sensor is very poor i have to literally get up each time and go close to the tv about cms apart and use the remote which is really irritating they should work on this issue product of one plus tv was good but the customer service is worst of amazon if you buy a tv in amazon the installation will done for year or more days it will take and then they tell us to do installation of our nearby technician they tell us to give money to them we will pay you in amazon pay balance but also they doesn t pay and they always tell us update in hours something up to now it happened one month so i tell you to don t buy in amazon facing many lagssound voice is low back ground voices noisy nd disturbing while watching any showsdisplay little flickeringpicture more saturatedremote connectivity slowsuddenly it s restartsvery laggymany bugsone plus waste i ordered product aug but untill now no installation installation team will escape ny saying false statements so finally after days i got installation by my own amazon will provide money for installation just amazon pay balance no proper response from amazonbetter go for high end models sometimes apps or programs is strucking it will take time or we will switch off the tv to restart app will not not close automatically if another app is running some disappointed all features are good days remaining for my device warranty and its display is gets black worst experience with oneplus i brought this device because i am using oneplus pro mobile i it s customers service not even pick up my call very disappointed everything is fine at this price i believe you cannot get a good brand and this quality its just tv lags a bit but it is negligible at this price it is the best tv and picture plus sound quality is too good its a good tv for its price but there are some smart features are not there one of the example is there is no browser on the tv the customer needs to add it a different way or pay for it etc but otherwise its good tv worst ever experience with one plus couldn t pair my iphone with chrome cast very second day the display issue popped up contacted amazon for replacement and they said not possible bought it on emi and returning the tv now lost money on emi conversation charges and gst amount by bank amazon never cares flipkart is better than amazon on customer experience defective products worse customer experience with most customer eccentric company on earth this tv is perfect and one plus doesn t need any marketing stunt and this tv price is perfect compare to other tv brands and picture quality is perfect and yes sony bravia also comes close to this but i would like to go with one plus value for money nice at this rate tv s pixel s are dead audio quality is not good it is loud it does not have miracast we have to cast our phone screen with help of google home and the most irritating thing is speed of tv it s very slow obviously it have bluetooth remote but sometimes tv response very lately i was not expecting this but overall it s fine i will prefer you to buy mi tv instead of oneplus tv thanks product is good but installetion service is very very bad anybody not call me i called several times to instslletion technition he did not respond finally i installed my tv through local technition dont buy product from amazon service not good tv takes a while to start without anything displaying on tv so it becomes really tricky as you wouldn t know if tv is turning on or not the picture quality is very good for the price voice recognition is also slow at time it misses your first word osm if you want to waste your money then buy this tv i had also bought thinking of oneplus brand value but this tv can t even connect to wifi and if it gets connected miraculosly it will automatically disconnect after or minutes oneplus should drop the name smart tv as it cannot even connect to wifi so i returned it don t go only by brand name oneplus don t have any experience in making tv s so avoid oneplus tv s look for alternative brands just perfect no description needed i really liked the tv though i expected more from oneplus but as it comes for rs it is just perfect the features are good picture quality is decent sound is awesome that comes with dolby atmos and the remote is bluetooth configured which is very nice if you are willing to buy a inches smart tv this is the best option you can go for it simple trick to hang the tv play any vedio on youtube off the tv frm remote on the tv frm remote the oneplus y series tv get hang noting works unless you unplugged and plugged in again plz try with your one plus y series tv and share your feed back the tv software is not properly tested and launch in market some time screen get blur only volumes come and pictures get hang it takes to sec to start waiting for any upgraded patch from oneplus expecting to be fixed with software upgrade picture and sound quality is good good to watch movies in in tv i bought an inch tv at price of k only draw back is sometimes is becomes slow or screen gets a lag and it came back to home screen no wall mount attached to this tv bad installation experience worst product dont buy this one i know its very cheap but plz dont waste your money its been the st night my remote is not being able to switch on the tv it lags hangsup many times a day sound quality is worst go for any other brand but not one plus never expected this third grade quality product there s even a colour fluctuation while playing the video sometime and its not even two days you will get what you pay for i had high hopes at first and ordered it through amazon the installation service by one plus is satisfactory but the television is where it all spills it will work properly for the first couple of months and then the experience gets really laggy the contrast is really bad and the sound quality is average it is a one time investment please go for sony or samsung by spending more but dont buy this stars out of worst tv worst customer service my tv stopped working with in two days due to some software issue service centre people also very unprofessional and dehradun service centre have no knowledge about tv softaware they are failed to resolve the issue which is still pending please dnt buy i am giving this review after using it for months but i am facing the issues from day one the tv hangs all the time and its really slow when i asked amazon to fix it i was told by the technician the system will update in few days and after that is will work properly after updating it twice its same dnt your waste money i thought its one plus brand so i bought it but regretting now sound the most disliked thing is the sound of y serie and one more thing is the speaker comes without tweeter its like local speakers voice picture quality good of value for money this comes for the ones budget under k oneplus connect is a lit bit laggyfull plastic body not a even metal used in the body i bought this television october within one year suddenly display dissapered that s ok it in warranty so i want to replace it but the worst part which is i dint expect from one plus is very worst service for television it s been months till now no repair just calling up customer service still they will never get back to me my serious recommendation is not to go for one plus tv and i will end tv looks premium and slim and very light weight voice it low than usual inbuilt speaker is too low even for small room you need to use extra bluetooth speaker but what else you expect in this price i got this in k which is serving purpose overall i am not at all satisfied with the picture quality also there is a fault in the remote not at all happy with the product the tv installation person came when the return window was closed this is not expected from amazon this is disgusting i want to return this product do not buy this product the dealer is delieviring old items from the godown i have purchased one it it s display is scratched when i call amazon customer help they denied to replace item and call me that you have to check when item is delievered that was so minor how can we confirm in once please by from the local shops istead of amazon the product was amazing picture quality was so good sound quality of the tv is good but the tv not connecting with the mobile and google assistant is of no use and it s not connecting to the device the wall mount was not given with the tv the technician is worst he does not gave complete information about the tv the technician doesn t know anything i need abetter demo so plz send another technician thank you i have had this tv for nearly months now and i ve had a horrible experience neither the quality nor the software is acceptable there is so much lag everytime i switch on the tv or open an app highly recommended not to waste your money and time on this picture quality is not good not bad hangs up while switching apps blank black screen while opening apps sound lag while connect to blue tooth speak or alex blue tooth heeps disconnect and re connect it s self while tv is ideal in minute atleast times one plus should thing while launching products under budget there is a problem in software bcz when it on i see some lagging problem there oneplus connect is not supporting properly picture quality is definately very good when i go through get more apps in apps section i have seen two lines so i thought it may be manufacturing fault but now i have got another one after replacing same two lines are there in panel tv not

always good to go n buy from your nearest shop don t buy this tv not even days display is gone poor service from amazon to claim warranty as long as all good amazon will be right choice if any

not even compared with lcd tv very poor software bluetooth mode is also not working properly remote is responding only when you pressed its buttons to times do not waste your money on this go for alternate brands like realme or tcl not wanted to give a single star to this tv but it is mandatory so i gave i recommend everyone never to buy this one plus tv ever bought this tv in august month and just after days cracking sound problem occurs i complained and they took more than a month to replace the speakers but the problem is still on and the company said sorry sir we can not do anything i just wasted my money product was awesome delivery also fast but pathetic service from amazon and cloudtail side because they forgot to put user manual and remote for the tv screws a battery without remote how can anyone able to operate tv pathetic service by amazon cloudtail i am a big fan of one plus the picture quality of tv is awesome but sound system would have been better i am using my logitech bluetooth speaker i request company to fix this issue otherwise k of our investment would be not wise decision excellent budget tv picture quality could be a improved a little but considering the pricing of the tv compared to lg samsung sony who go almost around k for zame inch model oneplus tv is totally budget friendly and perfect totally go for it without any doubt i request all the amazon user dont buy one plus tv it is useless tv my tv usb port is not working i complain to customer care still they have not send any technical person i have complain to time since last days useless customer support please buy another brand and dont waste your money in buying one plus tv the tv works like a charm all the features work and not much lag and the screen resolution is good the only problem i m facing is the remote doesn t sense voice commands love the picture quality and the stylish design at this price point have been using it for more than a year audio output could have been better overall great tv after months i am writing this i bought this bcoz of the brand oneplus conswhen you switch off the tv with remote i am unable to switch on with remote i have to manually press the button in the tvvery very laggy and slow uinot worth the money edited i bought the nd tv as the first experience improved over time liked the tv picture quality was good there seems to be a speed issue at start which was resolved by updating the os the product was from cloudtail india there was a deep cut on the centre of the display screen later when the other supplementary packets were inspected it was evident that the product was used and returned by some other customer cloudtail india should be authentic and trustworthy while dealing with customers very worst tv got scratches on the display of the tv claim for check thrice and yet my query doesn t get resolved never ever buy any products from amazon never ever buy any products of oneplus even i wanted to give negative star

better experience connectivity is very poor not even usb port is connecting properly google voice assistant is not working dolby atmos poor cheappp worst display panel blindly purchased tv for the brand oneplus but totally disappointed not user friendly don t buy oneplus tv only op s smart phones are good not any other gadgets reviewing this product after using months performance is really very good it s elegant look and sleek design enahance the feel of viewing but os updates needs to be done which will enhance the quality and performance worth buying smart purchase from amazon happy with the one plusblutthooth feature can be improved the tv remote does not function fast it is slow to remote commands plus remote does not have a sleep function overall performance of the tv not very satisfactory it lags in between and when we play ps it hangs every seconds it goes off stating no signal and comes back even after software update not much happy overall felling bad that i went for this when i had better options this product comes with good box packing and delivery boy unbox the tv at the time of delivery the feature of this tv is very good and easy to handle with simple remote and the voice recognisation feature is very good and also with good quality tv picture picture and sound quality is not so great service is good connectivity is also goodi am facing issue to connect with wifi after every or months it is automatically disconnected to wifi and when i am trying to reconnect it wifi turned off automatically i need to reset everytime but this solution not working as well frustrated with this the media could not be loaded when we turn on tv it is showing bright red blue white screens even remote isn t working sometime sound of the channels is hearable otherwise this is wht the problem of one plus wht should i do now help me anyone i ve been using this product since one month and the fhd experience is really amazing sound is decent vivid mode is not necessary because the standard picture mode gives great colors pros bezel less display great gamut range good remote controlcon backlight light is slightly visible when white frames appear nd image recommend external sounbars for better sound experience worst product worst after sale service no quality of sound no quality of picture and so much langig issues every app taking time to sec just for opening after use just months later find black spots in display and for service waiting from last months and ervery time customer support says we have still part not available spend more to get a better picture more ports on mi tv would not suggest a tv wgmhich says android and does not support chromecast tv body quality very poor cheap making profuct dont buy this product sound quality is also not so good buy sony tv very good product tv stopped working after months and till now i m chasing after customer care to get my tv repaired and it s been months and yet no proper response or resolution provided from both oneplus and amazon side worst customer service and very worst product build quality do not buy oneplus tv poor experience unable to connect chromecast and bluetooth takes much time to start apps service also very poor from amazon didn t expect this from oneplus very bad product i m presonally suggest to all buyers not purchased this one led sound quality not good picture quality also not good smart feature not work properly i have received defective tv after so long conversatation my tv is refund very bad product the product is decent but up to the mark the coloration is faded and not aligned the casting is solwer as internet explorer overall it is an ok product in this price not recommend though so first thing is that you cannot control this tv with the fire stick remotes power and volume buttons next thing is you cannot even connect it to alexa one plus support states that they will release a software update but not sure when the sound is so bad even my phone sounds better than this tv this product and service both have no standard a very poor quality products and services as well one must not look for online shopping especially on amazon where low quality products are sold at higher rates and damn bother service related issues not an wise investment if someone searching it from amazon sight would that i have returned it in stipulated time period product looking is ok but don t know what is the issue when open youtube all ok once select play video whole screen becoming black n white don t know why some times the remote to tv operation also slows down takes little time to open after pressing remote any how little disappointed with this tv thought of going to samsung customers satisfaction or support very bad product delivery is fine installation support very bad because i got a tv days are over still not coming technical person for installation i am once problem informed for customer care about installation he told me with in days we solve your problem but still not solved review after usage of monthsso many issues with the tv i will advise you to not buy this nonsense tv it takes min mins to turn on wifi ll automatically turns off many issues one line don t buy it the product was enough good for this price segment the only thing which i personally don t like is the sound quality tho there is dolby audio environment there in this the tv the sound seems to be mixed sound and not clear the oxygen play is also a good thing in the tv and sometimes the remote seems to be lagging while operating although a good and nice tv according to this price segment with amazing video quality it is an overall good product but the reciever of remote is in the bottom right corner it shall have been in the centre as everytime you have to point remote there also i am unable to use the connect app it is working great with wifi i have tried youtube and amazon prime sound quality is decent the media could not be loaded sometimes screen is getting flickering and same with the audio poor quality for that much price not a good product the software is bad bluetooth quality is bad tv is slow while working the sound also goes off customer care can not be easily accessed and then no turn around time guidelines please do not buy no repair available for days now really oneplus usb drive not working properly in tv fat nit support what to do its bug and can fix by simple update but still not happen poor service its a budget tv but dont expect it be sony first sony is priced very high and it delivers according to it to be honest i feel for this price range this is the best television packed with all features and also its one plus tv so had a better goodwil than other tv s in this range this tv is the worst product in my i have ever bought after days of purchase it started malfunctioning and one plus dont any solution even after months as they said that they have parts don t purchase it as one plus not able to give service and i recommend to amazon to remove this company from your portal tv build quality is very goood bt when come to its display part so much white and black spot found tv s sound quality is really good and loud company like one plus this type of issus is not expected i request amazon to replace my tv and they accept that tv have some problem on its display so they replace it asap the media could not be loaded waste of money i purchase it on last august now disply of my tv not showing anything without any reason i just update system n then disply gone wrong so according to me instead of oneplus u can for samsung or sony or else yes they r more costly then oneplus but they r value for money totally waste from day one itself tv getting hanged and more over remote not responding while power on volume will too noisy when we increase only good thing picture quality is good don t plan to buy this tv satisfy with this product picture quality is superb dolby sound of this tv is amazing voice recognition is very easy to use and very smart too bluetooth remote of this tv is goodoverall very good product must buy waste many complainants automatically switching off go with mi tv it s good the worsted tv i ve seen i made many complainants in oneplus customer care but they never responded and failed to send the technician even the technician dont have awareness about the tv and it s program he s just a hardware installer that s all he don t have the quality to treat the problem good android tv in the price range with decent picture quality and good sound quality impressed with the installation service by vecare the walmount was not a part of the package however got it for free as a part of the free installation the serviceman were v polite and professional amazon like flipkart should work on better extended warranty deals the flipkart one is quite a deal at for extra years after using this product for a week suddenly during usage of the tv there were lines all over the screen trying reaching amazon customer care and product provider from last one week but no one taking the responsibility of the product defect and i am not even contacted by the supplier this issue is been occurring after days so customer care is just saying that we can not return the product what should i do kindly guide good product one can purchase without much doubts volume and picture quality is good body quality remote is good with smart features buyers should avoid getting waylaid by negative reviews value for money light weight thin panel stand looks delicate for table top display if kids and pets around better to install on wall to avoid accidents overall satisfied is this a fake not a dolby atmos speaker voice quality is not clearity at high end volume and remote is too much laggy too much slow work on tv and tv is also laggy after back on any app and u want to go home screen is time to take also second badi badi baatey or vadapaun khate is that true dilounge for oneplus and another problem amazon installation service is provided me wall mount stand of mi brand not oneplus brand the tv is very good to have as a secondary tv the sound is great and the remaining qualities are simply superb the picture quality is really good for a inch tv and the bezel free design gives it a great look once the remote is connected there is no problem with the voice recognition or the controlling overall a great product for very less price must buy not value for money tv is not at par in comparison to other brands even in the mid segment poor picture quality and depth in color low grade android app is pathetic not a real product of one plus in comparison to the mobile experience i had huge expectations with this one plus y series tv but it turned out to be a huge disappointment for me the screen was having black patches bezels are very thin sound quality is okaypicture quality is awesomevoice recognition is delay for sec but it is okay at this price rangeand the remote control is very handy the media could not be loaded bad experience bad product bad service repair service too late no positive response from amazon and oneplusworst tv ever don t buygoogle assistant not working complaint times no solution my one plus inch tv not running properly today service man also visited and tell now your tv is updated at that time tv run on wifi but now it is wifi is turning on off automatically and not connecting installation services is to bad he was not fixing your septop and also i was requesting him sir plz can u fixed the septop boxx and also informing us about products operating details but he straightly telling no i am here for open and fix the but he is misser and also tv speed is too much slow but viewing quality is amazing and etc thing s is also good but installation services is useless the media could not be loaded bought a wall mount bracket it was movable and great by the installation person very much kind of him even though bracket has to be wall mounted drilling on wall there wasn t even a dust on the floor installer was using the drilling machine with dust collector it s a good product by oneplus but the main problem was the tv installation because of the pandemic it s too late for installation of tv so it s better to buy offline rather than buing online picture quality is good sound quality is ok smart function not so good very slow time consuming software getting time to open the apps overall rating is value for money i had purchased android tv from amazon after month used android tv was blank screen i called the oneplus customer care but i didn t get any response so i request all oneplus customers don t purchase any android tv from oneplus i didn t get any calls i had lost my money also thankyou just got the tv delivered a great product in inch segment from the brand sound quality is good picture quality is superb as well remote is very smooth easy to set up by self build quality is also very good worth buying it as a entry level product the only flaw i had witnessed is only hdmi port support audio output pathetic picture quality its essentially an lcd selling as led an poor response from amazon buy some other brands and not from amazon since they re irresponsible stands are bit loose if u make your tv stand on legs on a table u feel so scared because the even after tighten up the screws well still they are moving and sound quality need to be improved the dolby punch is missing i like the tv pretty much the picture and sound quality is the best valued at this price segment but the only problem with the tv is depicted in the second pic i posted i don t understand why it s happening when i change the channel for two seconds then it comes to normal very disappointing with this new product of one plus because screen not appear issue found within months of purchase and the service is poor service center not available at nearby guys do not waist ur money to buy this buy samsung sony tv we are not getting service nor replace the products by amazon or one plus company i am worried about this product because it s no perform properly i have to start it through push button on tv can t start it by remote controls i want replacement of this product the media could not be loaded i got worest tv one plus y i bought this tv months back now the display of the tv is shown in the above video no quick service also no one can t respond properly there s no immediate service sent a defective product remote is not working when installing time technician found it no replacement confirmation from oneplus amazon said we can t do replacement its done only by manufacturer better option is canc the product and take refund than purchage other brand waste of time and affords the media could not be loaded tv getting freeze every one or two days you can t do anything with tv you just need to unplug the power from electricity this not end also you will not get any support for this issue i went all social media sites twitter facebook customer care still no solution with tv the sound quality is not at all good anyone trying to purchase please go for a better brand not oneplus recently i put a new pendrive it asked me format after format the pendrive got corrupted this tv not support alexa amazon cheated me with fake advertising poor picture quality in normal cable connection in hd it s ok poor sound quality must have sound bar overall ok amazon customer care is good but i didn t get installation from the company i done from a local repair guy so plz confirm it before buy good product i have and size wise decent sound quality also good if you compare with money google assistance is greate picture quality also decent not as sony but in this price range it s satisfactory for me i bought it last month if it will work yrs or more than that then it s paysa wasul please don t buy this productno customer support if you face any issuesi have faced technical issue no proper response from support team becareful before buying amazon delivery is excellent but the installation service is worst one plus tv at this price of is really worth reliance digital service is good and faster than amazon and the service from reliance digital is excellent i was hoping someone will turn up for demonstration as i am facing difficulty in downloading new apps but no one came for demonstration although the installation was tedious and we had to call external help other than that it is a good product the media could not be loaded we purchased this one plus tv twice one of the remote stopped working and no support provided by amazon and one plus tv is useless without remote no physical button in tv is given and no replacement of remote available in market good product picture quality is good surround sound works well fairly responsive ui expected awesome picture quality and premium ui quality and response but it s not there so didn t feel like a one plus brand tv ui clarity is very bad feel like it is pixelated but video picture quality is good the tv stopped working in less than a year nyc product i have been using one plus for last yrs and i m very satisfied with the quality that one plus offers and this smart tv form one plus is also good good product in this segment but sound quality is average oneplus should improve sound quality and remote response is also littile bit slow and it s wifi connectivity only support ghz oneplus should work on these cons i like its best feature is one plus connect app it is connect phone to tv to use phone like remote and screencast etc i bought my tv on st march and installed on rd march and i experience with too good quality but it become zero brightness on march i raised a complaint and verified by technician and i placed a replacement now i received a new product on th march and i m waiting for installation i m hoping for this will be good than my old product screen flickering started immediately after installation installation also not went smoothly no proper supportno priority to customers received the defective productasked the amazon executive to replace the product but they he said it is only possible after the technician visit but technician cancled my appointment without informing me later i received sms to reschedule the technician visit i don t understand whats happening with the amazon please dont buy these product one of the worst product from the oneplus bought this on aug and in less than a year the picture went off had to get it repaired twice after the warrenty it happened in th month again and having to pay out of pocket the tv has great picture quality and it is very hard and tasking to pair the remote control to the tv but for sound quality you will need speakers with a sub woofer as the tv sounds like old toshiba laptops arguing over who gets to charge first ram is too less picture quality is poor only offers pxslow processorwhen done screen cast there is a lag between both the screens phone and tv which is again a problemdo not purchase this tv because you can have other brand tv in market in same price with better configuration one plus tv and features are good but as amazon showing combo with alexa it s not pairing and there is people who wrote about this on oneplus site although cutomer care telling to contact oneplus although amazon is promoting as combo could not have asked for more in this price the tv is perfect just as one would expect from a oneplus device but it is better to get a soundbar with it for amazing sound poor software optimization the tv works fine however while watching netflix the tv will automatically change to oxygen play screen i have reset the tv hope that fixes the issue very nice tv in this price range from one plus picture quality is superb sound quality is ok ok but better than mi tv sbuilt quality is also goodtv looks premium because of bezel less design remote controller is also made of good quality plastic and it is very good looking no wall mounted stand or at least screws for stand not providedunsatisfied with thisuntil than tv is very good dont buy seriously telling you guys instead buy mi or vu tv too many bugs in one plus tv netflux and chromecast not working properly quality is good butit lags while on and offscreen mirroring is not possible with vivo phonesit only works when external speakers has the hdmi supportchrome casting has issue even when i disconnect the youtube or wynk it keeps playing on the tv screenhoping that oneplus will have the ota updates very soon to fix these issues after sale service was worst don t buy this product repair parts are not available and for any service you have to take many follow up go for mi led tv much better than this one from months continuously taking follow ups of the service team for the wifi connection issue every time i getting different reason worst product worst service not to suggest to buy this product after one week of purchase lines on screen with picture enlarged service man came and told it s software problem and rectified but the problem repeated again in one week service man told that the display should be changed so booked again for service no responce till ten days very bad service and waste to buy this picture quality is good features is fine

awsume oneplus has come up with this smart tv as very low cost and as per the picture sound quality it is amazing only drawback i found in it is that there is no option available to set picture or sound quality it will be default and depend upon your connection due to this you get sharp colors and the base of sound is also very low cancelled another brands order to get this a little disappointing when it keeps hanging every once in a while picture quality and user interface is great though except picture quality nothing is good remote response painfully slow voice feature not working dumb tele customer support mi farway better than picture quality is best but sound and remote control is not at all good the tv is strucking and not working smoothly and it s not connect not controlled by alexa echo dot worst product too much lags no clear volume it cannot be returned and even wall mount stand have charges what the benift of service then donot buy for brand go to another

any key from remote it takes few seconds to capture display is decent though you had experience of kdesign is good but sound quality is worst looks like your listening to a china model phone with no clarityhence would suggest to buy bluetooth speaker or home theatre or a good sound bar too late delivery even for prime customer it took days to get in home tv material quality was too bad and manufacturing defect in top left corner at frame disapointed with product quality and delivery picture quality was good sound quality was average if your looking for a tv around k consider mi k tv and decide the media could not be loaded installation done finally i m happy now it s nice tv the media could not be loaded the built quality picture quality is too good premium looks at a reasonable price an issue with the oneplus connect app on android device the quality of sound could have been better amazon had delivered the product in less than hours a big shout out for that the picture quality is average and sound quality is poor after using it for some days the screen started showing discolouration which is very bad experience i think one should not invest their money in on this product features are good so far but audio output is very low and not enough also when i bought a speaker bar came to know that tv doesn t have aux output as well so i have to entirely rely on bluetooth one plus an amazing quality product with nice and sharp picture quality user friendly functions excellent sound quality also feel full screen picture enjoying with basel free screen and

eyes it s sound quality isn t as good as vu cinema tv but it s okay at this price point if you really want to enjoy a good picture quality then go for it worst experience with one plus inches tv never go with one plus inch variant major issues with red blue green vibrancy worst voice recognition feature don t buy one plus inches tv initiated for refund and refund and return done thanks to amazon india good tv at this price segment first thank you amazon for one day delivery display is very good cinematic experience performance is very good and smooth due to processor bezel are excellent sound much not good but better for small room overall it is a good tv at this price segment you can go for it the tv is also goodno installation issuebuild quality sounds quality resolution and color temperature most affordable of middle and lower class family considering price it was good at display but audio quality was not up to the mark remaining all the best the thing is the sound quality in the price along with the features available please do not buy very poor customer service my tv is not working properly for last months and the issue is not resolved till date giving one star because tv having bluetooth connection issues every time we have to pair bluetooth device to use and after connecting to bluetooth broken sounds is coming the picture quality and view angle is very poor in degree angle the display looks like a one big white patch not expected this from one its a ok ok tv gb ram is too low and frequent freezing happens while switching between apps mostly noticed while watching youtube sound is below average at this price point you cannot complain excellent craft and finish audio video quality is great compared to mi tv best tv in the television hanging alot and sound quality is also very poor ar this price range it is very good u can t compare this with sony but ys all over good product bad sound qualitypicture quality is goodon off button prblmlaggy ui product is very nice however installation service is pathetic even after three days of delivery no one turned up for tv installation raised a complaint at customer care but to no avail dont buy any one plus product after sales service is zero its more than a year of continuous calling to one plus but no response from any customer service executive mi is better than one plus worst it stopped working after a week nice television in this budget i am happy about the features and the look the television give me to my living room the media could not be loaded display worst quality and my display had problem months back still are saying display out of stock service also very worst better to buy samsung or vu or lg etc another brand don t buy oneplus tv this is a nice tv but don t expect much from this tv not the software quality expected from onepluspros good picture quality good sound quality sleek designcons bugged software not responsive sticks a lot bad ui experience weak processor compared to other tv it has been more then months but yes the product is good but some time the response time of switching applications take a bit more time turning on your tv through remote some time becomes pain full as the response time is slow perfect bedroom television for medium size rooms should bundle wall mount as well because the installation agent used a local mount and it doesn t look good as it s a very thin tv sort of picture frame voice and picture quality is nice also voice recognition works like a charm i was a bit sceptical to go with plus since in previous reviews sound quality was rated low i went with plus anyways and i am extremely satisfied sound quality is good and u have tolhe ability to modify it as well the tv if defective and it has been reported on the amazon portal but nothing has been done even after days after the complaint was registered need to fix sound quality remote lag screen on time need to reduce screen mirroring need to be enhanced tv lags or hang during switching over appsoverall value for money very worst instalment days left iam purchasing product tilldate istall not done service engineers also worst talking just minit i will be there but days left where is the your service engineer when did install the product waiting for u perfect budget tv with a good brand loaded with lots of features plastic is very cheap broken while tightening the screws it s the worst tv just for months it s display gone its an problematic smart tv with lags n hdmi port problems and from a month i am asking for the oneplus team to support but no one is interested tooo much faltu tv don t buy the chromecast has its own attitude doesn t work when you want it to the system needs to be restarted all the time the picture automatically starts blinking and goes multicoloured and pixelated not something expected from oneplus great quality video didn t find any issues with audio either wish it had wall mount included the media could not be loaded this one plus tv purchased before months ago after that i am facing a problem now showing me some black spots on display in diffrent place while i am watching it others features are good quality but build display quality is not satisfied lags too much you have try atleast times to get it on picture quality is moderate but sound quality is poor after wall mounting it seems i made huge mistake buy picking this up by the brand name and slightly cheaper price great tv at this price picture and sound quality both are awesome the wifi capacity and range is also very strong no need to think twice before buying this tv fulfilled all the expectations i had with oneplus smart features are good but when connected to stb through hdmi brightness is automatically getting reduced resulting in worse picture quality when tried stb through hdmi along with this brightness issue audio is not coming through at all when we try to verify the device through oneplus in by entering serial number it will show invalid device code also not able to connect alexa to tv don t trust amazon one plus tv is good the media could not be loaded this is by and far the best buy for the pricetag remote and tv is simple to setup an update might be needed on first boot sound isn t the best especially if the room is bigger and unit isn t mounted there are no response from customer service and customer service very poor they not answer my complaint to display not working from purchas great picture quality when you watch netflix and amazon prime youtube playback also is great tv speakers are average and can be improved airpods and other bluetooth headphones can be connected bezel less display as mentioned feels wonderful overall worth the price from oneplus it is just days before this one plus inches tv delivered to me and you can see the image which i attached the tv screen is not working it looks like again the proved that we should not buy any product from any chines company this is the quality of product of giving by one plus now days such a worth less product display have problem some led lights not work its showing black dot lot several places its really disappointed for me i purchased with emi its was still going but tv shows like this what can i do for this problem the media could not be loaded quite good tv but not impressed with the sound quality at all need to purchase soundbar now oneplus connect is useful and unique thing which you will not see in any other televisions everything is better like picture quality sound quality and it s smart featuresmost important thing is that u can get one plus brand logo in this price my tv just one month old and one part is missing blutooth not working everytime showing retrieving data don t purchase electronics items from online local shops are better option the media could not be loaded the picture quality goes bad at any point of time it ends up hanging everytime and then i have to restart it everytime not knowing how many minutes it will work well further even after getting a replacement the issue still exists want to return the product as soon as possible the picture quality is awesome and it s value for money to buy oneplus tv in this price range no one can expect this type of picture quality and features one think i like to share with you guys that the it comes with bezel less display best product but ram is gb so some time it hang or it take time to load any application the tv is great but lags when it starts and the service of amazon is pathetic as no one has shown for installation till now as it has been days i have purchased this tv and always i have to reschedule for next day as they are not showing up at all worst service by amazon team got a damaged product and regretting now almost everyone is getting damaged piece pixels are dead from top right the product was delivered in time installation done but the television demonstration not done please depute your person to give a demo of the product you can inform the company i e oneplus to give the demo else we will find it difficult to operate properly all the features available bad repair service of onplus i m facing my month old tv spanel is not working and i submit request on oneplus care on dec and today jan till time i dont have any update of repairing bed experience with oneplus our oneplus tv display line damage months ago has not been repaired yet i am complaining but some answers are not coming from oneplus s customer care the tv has not been repaired yet but it has been repaired says customer care nothing to like unable to give zero star rating otherwise i ll give zero star s to this oneplus product and amazon home service as well i applied for warranty claims one month before but no resolution given by the oneplus or amazon i faced problem with the display just in months of my purchase and no one cared regarding my complaint even after waiting for days after my complaint registered amazon just tried to escape instead of resolving never go for it purchased tv during nov complaint registered for not working on till today not replaced the tv nor complaint cleared very poor response from oneplus customer service very good product by one plusin this segment no one gives this much clearityonly one thing i don t like is sound never buy any oneplus product service is very poor and no satisfactory response i bought one tv within a week it not working properly now almost more than a month no replacement or reply from oneplus tv customer service my overall rating for one plus tv is when i m functioning my home theatre remote one plus tv is responding i don t know why don t buy this go for some other brand instead like samsung or sony don t just go by the cost this tv is too laggy doesn t connect to internet switches off automatically while playing something the media could not be loaded best android tv not a hd tvpoor sound qualitypoor picture qualitywe recommend lg sony samsung everything thing is good except the installation and customer service the customer service is very poor forget about the complaint you raised you have to raised the same complaints multiple times screen minoring sometimes doesn t work properly and voice recognition is bit poor the smart features and pictures quality are very nice and the screen is best choice for bedroom or small size livingroom tv border is not protected hence need to use gently since launch of oneplus y it s promos promised an echo dot speaker at no extra cost i pre booked and waited for days to get one in flash sale but just before flash sale on prime day sale you removed the offer without any prior notice i realised it after making payment felt really bad not too good product my tv is hanging alexa not connecting few time blutooth connectivity with sound system create mess non recommend tv the media could not be loaded good product but wall hanging not ni box oneplus charge extra payment for this overall tv is okay picture quality is good voice quality is not upto the mark voice is not very clear no one has come for installation change command takes time it s not that quick the product was delivered as promised within hours installation and demo was done by the same team which delivered the tv so everything was smooth and hassle free from beginning to end performance of the tv is good too early to comment about the reliability though ghatiya customer service h tv ka panel ek saal mai khrb ho jaega or jb customer support pr baat kroge toh bss ghumate rhege na koi help krte h na kuch or jo yeh saal ki warranty dete h fraud h saale sirf ek saal ki hi warranty g one tv i bought a month ago so far satisfied with function app usage and picture quality drawbacks sound quality not good sound volume varies when using live tv and online tv netflix prime still i say worth buying dont buy thia product with in days my tv is not working i have raised times still no one came or no one call me for the product picture quality is very good and the tv gets stuck very often and it is not well functional at all please think and buy the tv if not try to buy some other brand or try to buy the other version of oneplus tv this tv is for the middle class people who can afford it and manages to use it still they get new tv every thing is up to mark except sound sound output could be slightly better external sources like sound bars is recommended rest is all good and reach the expectations of us from a brand like one plus i m falling in love with oneplus best screen best sound accurate it stopped working in just months reported issue with request ucat isd mechanic came and said issue with display panel i can t repair and he left now no one is updating me who will resolve this issue everything is good but mobile mirroring connectivity problem if option is there then it should connect directly without any other help of app and when i am searching in mobile it s taking too much time to search and after that not connecting dear sir i strongly recommend oneplus cm why because its worthynice one it s my cup of teathank youregardssuresh battugo green my display turned black after a month contacted the customer care and its has been over a month now still it s not yet repaired bought the tv for k and now it s been switched off for over a month worst service its been over a week and tv is working fine with apps and ui is also good we can even run tv wifi with mob hotspot its worthy not to bay because tv was automatically stop running service provider was not provide service till now again today on dated technician not visit my home till pm poor qualitydisplay got blank within months and no technician visit on complaining even for months regularly worst service by one plusplease do not waste your money to buy one plus tv don t buy this product in your life because this product is having display problems my display got spoilt no customer care service i have complain on sep but till date no enjinear visited to check my tv so don t buy this product no aftersales service worst product and also worst service ever it s been month and i didn t get my tv repaired don t buy this product picture is good and voice recognition and volume control and sound quality is good picture quality is good but sound quality is very bad did not expected this from one plus but picture quality is worth the view free installation is done wall mount is free ask delivery person if needed it s free of cost on time delivery and installation the display quality is very good at lower price sound quality is also good wall mount is not available with the tv we need to pay extra for the wall mounting i prefer to buy the wall mount stand along with the tv while online purchase itself display has bright spots which makes oneplus tv settled i purchased by seeing best seller and brand but bad experience i got with connectivity and oneplus connect app installation service also worst just he make tv on and went google voice search also not working my suggestion is better to go for sony samsung or lg picture quality is pathetic not in line with what they have claimed better to go with samsung if you have more rupees to spend smart features are good everything is really great but if it were had k support would have been perfect the support from amazon works really well we have a exchange so all support was fantastic tv itself is really good all smart features in the tv we are using for months now i can say we love this buy nice product with so many smart features good and decent picture and sound quality only denerit is the tv remote and it hangs like android mobile set but best product in this price range voice recognition option gone in a week and google assistance not working need special app for screen mirror option some mobiles not mirror wit it nice tv slim and clear software needs to updated they have some errors and i am hoping for update to come not worth for money lags a lot and display is average better to go for other brands installation not done by the team raised concerns with amazon multiple times but no response finally did through local service guy for product is good instalation on time better than vu cinema picture quality sound quality is bad than vu cenima so friends you want best picture go for oneplus or for sound quality go with vu cinema the tv has some bugs like android mobiles have like hanging screen decolourisation while watching n delay in remote response system especially struggle in turning on through remote product okinstallation company is not good he send a local installation boy he was not a well trained about oneplus tv he was not explained about options he was charged for installed the tv amazon please u not recommend the company to other customer everything is averaging like all other brands tv is slow in comparison with other brands wall mount not included in the set and is to be paid in cash while installation which has not been mentioned anywhere while purchasing it friends please don t buy this tv from amazon

irritation picture quality is very vey bad looking like a cheap quality tv colours are faded initially i was supplied a dead used tv subsequently it was replaced but installation is an issue i have been told that as oneplus is a new entrant in tv business so technicians are less thus installation slot is difficult to get beware before you select amazon as well one plus company was not able to

sharpness colour resolution not upto mark refund issued only for tv price of extended warranty has not been refunded please do the needful ye tv ko saal se jyada ho gaya par aaj bhi st din jesa kaam

video and audio some other problem also there so please can u correct the problem with technition with urgent thank you not happy with the color reproduction while watching youtube it looks too dark one plus is great tv picture quality is great only issue is that tv wall stand not available inside the tv box and the installer person charged rs for that that should be free at the time of installation tv is good i m bit disappointed on the sound quality it is proper only after enabling the dolby processing and there is a lag sometimes i did not expect this in a oneplus product but overall when compared to price with the product it s worthy it s really a good product at that price specially the picture quality of tv great sounds on tv streaming on tv such a good experience it s been a month and didn t face any issues with my tv don t buy it hangs the remote doesn t respond voice search doesn t work i was facing bluetooth issue and thanks to amazon they accepted the return within days using a amazon basics fire tv k and in love with that worst mirror cast experiencetoo much laggingsuddenly disconnectedtoo worst product from one we believed one don t compromise on products quality but worst experience waste of my time because of eagerly waiting for tv money also value for money installation services is worste and he give rs stand and got amount of from my mom this is free installation only this product doesnt support same day installation you will have to wait another days to get it install by technician also amazon doesnt support customer if you try to unbox it by yourself the product is so amazingdefinitely a value for money providervoice command work perfectlyafter update this tv is working far betterbut be carefull while holding it because its display is as this as a average pencil tv is good and the menu navigation is so good very good picture quality but need to improve on sound for the small budget tv is overall good but there is scope of improvement product and product deliver so good but installation team worst product deliver very fast but installation team more then days still not yet come also no respond anything after updating tha apps cable channels become extremely dim making them very difficult to view one plus tv is good but remote is worest it s not working properly and if we operate tv we go to in front near by cm to tv it s a big issue and when we connect bluetooth soundboard and speakers it s not working properly this is worst product in one month the display not working the one plus company says this is got damaged and cannot cover under the warranty i will recommend not to buy any electronic products on amazon very much disappointed with the product first thing is tv is lagging so much it is taking minutes of time to respond second thing is that picture quality is poor when dark colours appear on screen grey colours are flashing over it the media could not be loaded voice recognition and sound quality are awesome picture quality can be improved video quality is not upto expectations it is mentioned that it can be controlled with alexa but it is not working this model i will not support to alexa they are mentioned simply product is super but amazon service is worst and they provide fake information regarding installation even customer care answers also not satisfactory they always gives false commitment regarding installation so don t buy through amazon i would suggest you to go with tcl p e series rather than this tv there is only gb ram i pre booked this tv because of trust on oneplus but the quality is not upto mark tv is slow and sound quality is poor please don t buy this product it s a good product at cost effective got a defective product them im not sure replacement product would be a good one so i opted to refund it was very disappointing experience with amazon for getting a defective product overall it took days to complete this deal sound quality is not good i didn t expect this chromecast is not working well the irregular connectivity of you tube in the tv is major reason for declining this product on top rank i have purchased oneplus y series cm inches hd ready led smart android tv y black model but delivered with me another model of one plus tv please rectify tv delivered to me having a hdmi port issue raised multiple complaints with oneplus and the issue has been closed without even the fault being attended totally the one plus support sucks wouldn t encourage anyone going for it excellent product satisfied but picture quality is slightly on the brighter side sound system is good android is a bit slow but ok for gb ram overall good purchase this tv has many missing features you can not change any mode of picture sound during watching video you have to go into settings sound not good tv hang if open multiple apps wow amazing led tv from oneplus picture quality is nice no doubt looking nice frameless but sound quality is poor but enough is single room but picture quality give star the picture quality is descent not too good remote control is also good but sometime it did not work properly sound quality is very low i will suggest you to go with another smart tv options also casting to a phone is a head ache in this the product is super but the service part is not that good i ordered this product on november nd and the installation has not yet completed this is not fair this will impact on amazon and the customers usb is not working always showing error i purchased new pen drive and it s working in my laptop and mobile otg but it s showing error in inch tv it showing corrupted problem in tv waste of time within days of purchase there has been an issue of motherboard wi fi connectivity remote not working blue screen very often have been following up with amazon from th of november till date have not had any resolution i have complained a problem regarding remote malfunctioning next day after it s installed but so far no rectification action is take it s almost two since it s installed even the sound is not clear we sent back the product just after unboxing it amazon prime was just not logging in after repeatedly trying by us and installation person we could not crack it so we decided it to just return it we bought it with great expectation and turned out to be a bad decision tv is very good but the installation service is worst after two months the free installation service have not materialised so i have installed it myself without caring about warranty hanging and restart issue oneplus phone is good but tv is very poor quality not expected from one plus why extra charged for stand stand does not come with tv product is ok with its pricing but services rendered by amazon is absolutely poor don t purchase anything during sale bcz they don t tend to come back to your problems even amit ceo is not bothered oneplus best owsm feature sound is very good and picture quality also means that it is very good if someone takes advice from me i will only do one plus actually my brother suggest me for one plus thank bro its too much goodthank you getting current shock on edges and amazon is arranging the technician techinician wont come and he ill update the status like service completed worst product and worst service from amazon there s no installation done don t buy a tv from amazon if you want to buy buy it from flipkart where they will installation in one or two days of delivery and oneplus service is also worst and tv quality is also worst excellent features nice product and

calls overall i won t recommend it the media could not be loaded worst tv i brought in my lifeyou can go for a video the product is awesome everything is working perfectly fine but there is leg issue in bluetooth while connecting a bluetooth device the audio has a latency bought on th dec problem with display in less than a month ordered for service check scheduled on jan i am really afraid that oneplus is selling a tv unit without a wallmount bracket and the worse thing is if buy a bracket from outside it will not fit into the tv jack in this case it is a must that oneplus should include a wallmount bracket in the total package the one tv is amazing only issue is installation no service from one in my town so be careful when you want to purchase remote not working after days worst product tv is also very sluggish got that tv delivered today and yes i am happy picture quality is superb after changing settings audio quality is ok ok as compared to realme tv after mounting it the audio quality improves overall best tv in this price range the tv is a lot slower than the most android tvs availavle in the market all r good but picture quality is not satisfaction amazon has delivered a faulty product i had gifted this product to one of my friend and he found out that this product is not working now amazon is not even taking it back this is my worst experience with any online shopping platform the media could not be loaded good product but dust going to inside i want to service it takes at least mins to bootsometimes remote doesn t work over all good product by oneplushowever sound quality is below average one plus budget smart tv is really good in every perspect the only thing bad about it is it s interface it hangs a lot and takes a few seconds to open up things otherwise no doubt it is a really good product everything in the tv is perfect expect the lag sometimes it lag but for few minutes tv process lagging and sound quality with dolby audio loud but not clear sound and display quality average i purchased the tv a couple months ago i is damaged within months the service is worst i am trying to get service under warranty but it always shows technicians not available i recommend it to buy this product i cant expect this from premium brand tv blacked out automatically with in one week from the day of purchase even the service guy cant identify the problem asked for refund from amazon risky buying don t get fooled by the brand name low sound quality suddenly visual audio cut off revert back some technical r software issues its really a good option at this price point my review after using it for one week its really good so far shall update after using for some time supplied tv which is manufactured months ago sound quality is bad tv doesn t respond well to the remote hangs a lot was a big fan of oneplus but kinda disappointed with this tv will be glad if oneplus gives us an update so that the tv doesn t keep hanging everytime the quality of picture is great only thing that needs improvement is the maximum volume which seems a little on the lower side and hard to hear from the other corner of a big room just can t believe with this trusted brand so many problems facing with my smart tv time replacement and now screen resolution problem now waiting for brand representative to see the problem and give some solutions waste it switches off in de middle v need to on tv agn hanging problem the picture quality is okay and tv is great for this price point one thing i dislike about this tv is that it is slow

suitable to this product it would be btr if depreciated worst tv con job it will not work and will not be replaced amazon is cheating customers knowingly side angle view is dull it ok when watching from front if someone sitting in a side than color and picture not appear good its dull sound not good product is having quality issue from the day one a thin blue line appears on bottom of screen service person tries to solve the problem on phone everything is top quality overall the tv is good after days of usage but there is a heating issue in the mother board mainly when i connected the usb drive very good product among the others in this price segment tv is okay not amazing but service was worst installation was not done and customer support not halping for installation bad review only becz of installation nice service from amazonnice sound picture quality is good but slightly changed while viewing from side angles casting is too slow may be due to low ram good tv in this price range video quality need to be improved sound quality is also not upto the mark very good product with good picture quality and added smart tv features however the audio quality could be better the maximum sound available is not enough in a spacious living room not recommended nice picture quality amazing colour sound is awesome smart tools with very smart feature of oxygen play value of money pathetic finishing though picture may be good but the gap between glas and plastic cover gives room for dust accumulation inside tv ok picture quality and sound quality is good no wall mounting stand includes no mm audio out port i but it few months ago the remote takes a lot of effort to work tv apps just randomly get lagged need to work on the processor it s oll good but remote control may be change i purchased it blutooth pairing problem always ask to pair when you on tv pathetic sound quality though the picture quality is good ui lags some times chromecast doesn t work smoothly worest installation service i bought the product one month ago still installation not complete picture quality is not as expected from oneplus brand other features are good enough for this price superb picture quality value for money would be more better if comes with a higher ram for fast loading overall good experience but only tv s frame disappointing me tv boundry like defective there is a gap between display frame not finishing excellent product from one plus but very poor service from amazon as the installation keep on rescheduled automatically and cancelled at last points for amazon for

quality is superb sound quality is not so high overall it is a good tv to buy for i can t plug my music system as there was no plugin point for audio i am connected it through bluetooth it s a major drawback picture quality excellent an excellent product in budget segment only problem that i see is it has gb ram which makes the responses slow didn t got echo dot which is shown free with this product one plus google remote voice assistant not working superb quality picture quality is utmost and it is best in the segment amazing experience with oneplus tv nice to have keeping aside the sound quality rest the tv is a great deal at this price also sound wilk not be an issue for those who will have a normal usage picture quality is blurred not good received defect product didn t expect this from oneplus the software is so laggy its unusable at times hoping for updates soon on october th booked against tv under warranty but it s need days now still i didn t got repaired tv verry bad service from oneplus team think twice bfore buy one plus tv honestly saying don t buy this tv very poor audio quality i recieved this tv having software issue good product for this price this is the best tv yet only the picture qualit in sd is downgrade but if you watch in hd quality is superb if you are low on budget definately great buy tv stands are in very bad quality don t install this tv with table stand which quality is worst it was broken automatically while running tv and causing screen damage picture quality i dislike about the media when we use usb drive we can forward or backward but it comes out from the movie so need more updates and sometimes chromcast works laggy so need to improve but all is good nice product with great features the picture quality is good and at this price range and with so much smart features its a worth buying the media could not be loaded nice product and nice picture good quality audio video just got installed today loving it till now

the centre of the display not what i expected but ok this tv is slim looking at beautiful sound also good picture quality nice excellent sound quality with average picture quality wort for the price sound system is good and picture quality is great but the only problem is that it s ui is a little laggy otherwise all around its a nice one at this price range very bad product not working properly almost one month pass nobody responding for warranty claim service very bad experience don t want to shop again from amazon the picture clarity is best in this price segment it s no doubt better than realme and mi tvs in picture and sound wonderful product for the price sound quality is very good picture quality nicevoice control nicesound bit low but w mentioned so its appropriate as w looks nice overall definitely recommend there is no screen share as well pen drive video quality very low money waste worthable with low cost compare to other companies and good quality never buy this model its better to go for mi interface is too dead slow and getting restarted after some time i like the picture quality of this product the os and ui need to improve sometimes it doesn t respond and freezes

appearing in the screen when switched it on the media could not be loaded sound is good and when the tv blink check the update delivery was good and safe speakers are very poor and there is no aux connection to connect the external speakers there is no other option than discarding this tv and no technical support available picture quality is good but sound quality is not good i did not received

product is best among the class amazon is unable to provide installation service in a timely manner and will keep on delaying it days they would take to get it installed picture and sound quality is very good and oneplus connect app working really good compared to other tvs it is thin and maximum screen but amazon tv install service is the worst overall it s good but sounds quality is very bad the picture quality is just okay but i guess it is specific to my tv but there are black lines and dark areas in the panel can t recommend it over similarly priced tvs not supporting for the web camera and the technician who visit doesn t know on product info tv was good as expected picture quality was good sound is also good dolby atmos sound easy to access everything don t buy this tv

picture quality but sound is poor also if we sign in to google and operate the tv it is super slow i bought this tv a month ago and it has a display issue contacted amazon customer care service many time but no help worst experience ever from amazon some times the audio is muted in cable connection to get back the sound we need to play video in youtube or any video from streaming platform i think its can fix with update good product but one plus more work needed for one plus tv so this television is good and has nice picture quality and good speaker skillsmust buy product front view color r ok but if u watch from side colors r very dull i think buy can be avoided explore another brand like samsung or sony nice deal and family also feel very happy very nice sound is bad it s not clear needs improvement it is a worth for the price product the seller has delay installation of the tv i e after one month software problem not work properly installation problem but amazon custmer service is best and also oneplus is batter than other product superrr duper tv picture quality is awesome like our very much now it s part of our family value for money i got this tv at big discount here all the

product means wow wowow wow wow amazing tv guys if u want the smart tv choose this i am using from days it s amazing i prefer mi tv over oneplus tv as it has few software issues and glitches remote doesn t work properly you will have to restart very nice tv two months now goin great and no issues whatsoever so far good product sometimes remote have some problem sound is good picture quality is good product also very good no doubt the media could not be loaded never expected to write a negative review for oneplus product screen flickering is the most common problem half of the times tv doesn t start with a single button press booting takes atleast seconds screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time audio is dud not sufficient for my x ft bedroom system lag is the maximum in this class of tv sedit amazon declined to replace and offered refund of as against k which i paid for the tv all i have to do now is to live with a defective tv as i had invested in the wallmount and the allied services oneplus settlededit product is back in stock amazon accepted for replacement after technician report but defective product is yet to be picked up and the replacement is yet to be shipped awaiting further details brand is not at all acting in the customers interest very bad response for oneplus edit received the replacement tv from amazon and the tv if working fine as of now i installed it on the wall by myself a bit of lag and sound issues but the screen stuttering is gone tv is beautiful with minute bezels i was pleased by the picture quality in firsti expected a smooth software from oneplus but tv operation is bit slow probably due to gb ram and lower clocked processor can t complaint at this price point wish oneplus would release better optimized software in update software update was one of my reason to buy tv from oneplus response from the bluetooth remote was bit slow but hold bluetooth was very functional might be as it is bluetooth tv was able to connect to devices at a time mobile bluetooth speaker and remote that s great coming to sound speaker quality isn t upto mark you have multiple options to enhance audio dolby surround presets dialogue enhancer etc probably that s the reason oneplus skipped mm output and opted for optical and hdmi arc ports to provide quality auido output on external speaker you should go rca audio adapters if you want mm input else connect to speakers using bluetooth adapter that would cost additional if you want to if you look for picture quality minimal design and stick to few ott app this tv is for you for power users and those who use only jack to connect speakers look else where update oneplus released major update and ui and remote control navigation seems improved now but setup of new bluetooth connection got buggy im not able to connect to new devices it is looping back to searching devices after clicking on device after search list ere is my experience with the oneplus laggy tv y model here is a list of issues with your product connected to samsung mobile through google home as the tv isn t connecting through samsung smart view always says unable to connect try again and even through the google home it is struggling too much to even cast the photos and forget about casting the videos neither windows nor mac is recognising the tv in wireless mode had to use third party app from play store to airplay my mac n gues what windows is not recognising the tv it is really shocking to see mac recognised where windows couldn t using third party play store app to my bad even through third party play store app it is laggy half of the times and how can i ignore to say about oneplus connect app its a wonders t app do the gesture wait for couple of seconds and then it responds and you can t access files through the connect app on this tv and sound it has options by the name dolby audio and dolby digital plus fix this in your mind these two features are just names and these does change the sound experience by zero percentage on youtube video quality is limited to p best to use hdmi cable to your happy and play k only then it felt better than any other video quality experience of this tv opening and closing apps is like suspense thriller movie scene experience you will be waiting to know when it will respond sometimes suspense extends to seconds viewing angles acceptable for this price colors green is worst of all and then red black is good blue colors are worst yellows are good and the rest that you find are acceptable display quality if any of you ever used the chinese phones of the last decade you will get the exact same feeling i promise you this best option to put good use of display and colors is to use pen drive hard disk or hdmi and play the k or full hd videos this is the only way that this display can make you happy and the remote the menu button literally never worked on any app nor on home page it just exists with void function assigned to it almost forgot about voice search that is google assistance out of times it took seconds to launch it opening an app fix in your mind that it will take at least once you connect bluetooth accessory you have to remove the device from the list if you want to connect it to other device you will not have an option to disconnect i will be brief here unboxing no wall mount no display cables plastic stands thin tv pros contrast ratio is amazing black level is amazing viewing angles r fine awesome colour accuracy latest android version cons poor quality speakers little bit laggy probably the os the panel is awesome tv won t lag when playing video and it s really okay android phones have similar issues as for speakers why would you use inbuilt speakers what matters most is contrast ratio colour range viewing angles and clarity they r all good in this price range no k k full hd tv could do better amazon installation i didn t get the wall mount cause installation guys were charging me for it tv is good amazon service is getting poorer after days usage display is good not best sound could have been better gamma engine not performed well ui is decent modern lightweight ui netflix amazon prime youtube and few apps are preloaded inbuilt chromecast performing well bezels design perfect best budget android smart tv major advantage of this tv is google assistant works like a charm everywhere and you don t have to type some bugs present in tv os first to review y as my experience with inch so far i liked the tv tv is by default on energy saving picture mode change to desire mode to get best picture experience as i changed many picture settings the picture quality is way better than mi realme me sound quality for my living room is more than enough dolby atmos work carm with my tatasky hd channels as they support dolby audio the lag is fixed to much extent last input memory is also fixed tv remembers the last input before switching off the installation was bit crisp as the guy didn t turn on the promised date so amazon escalated and yesterday new guy came and installated cherry on the cake the installation was free also the wall mount bracket worth rs was provided free by the installation team installed and the demo was given very promptly also to be noted this inches has different graphic processor than inches g mp updating my experience of days experienced lag nly twice in days tv takes a approx of min to get on there s a bit motion blur which would be fixed by update as it arises due to the dnr in the settings sound output is overall good at this range can t expect soundbar like bass pre book extended warranty has been activated and mail confirmation received from acko picture quality is just awesome with setting proper backlight contrast etc blacks are properly seen black this has va panel and i am not much concerned about viewing angles va panels are best for the straight view angle as they produce good contrast and color reproduction this tv does the same viewing angle can t be reviewed from my end as i did see blur when viewd at angle which is obvious for va panel data saver option and alexa support is yet to be updated in this tv as of now no alexa support for this tv as there s no option to login to oneplus account so my free echo dot is not of use with this tv as of now may be they will provide the update to this updating my review with some test done rgb colour gamat test is performing perfectly on this tv as you can see computer rgb reproduce proper color motion blur is too much in this tv expect to be fix via update tv remote is bluetooth and ir both i turned of my bluetooth of remote and using on ir as it s draining battery when on ir you can t use google assistant function no support for echo dot as of now confirmed hopefully will be in update no data saver option yet backlight bleeding is present at which is common for led tv color reproduction is good too updating my review to some clarification and my experience as echo dot is not compatible and no from oneplus has spoken about echo dot compatibility with y series i returned my echo dot for full refund those posting negative reviews due to echo dot not received kindly add echo dot from cloudtail in cart with oneplus tv u vll get it for free those posting negative reviews that after tv return oneplus gave nly rs please return your echo dot too they remaining approx rs will be refunded then only i connected my jbl sound bar and watched movies on prime i bet the dolby atmos did its work and its natural u can t expect soundbar sound at k pre book cashback of rs is credited to my amazon pay balance i got it delivered by july shipping was good but then bright spots started showing from the next day product quality isn t good too i advise you not to buy this oneplus tv s picture quality is good look feel is good i would quote best in this segment tvs i have explored most of the well noted brands in this price segment sound is with dolby digital plus enabled it is better tv build quality is good viewing angles are good too k videos will be reset to p and this is the maximum resolution for any video only gb memory is available out of gb oxygen play is useless there is bloatware instead of oneplus clean software motto accessing tv with oneplus connect app is out of its a disaster wall mount is free it will be brought by installation provider do not shell extra bucks for wall mount or installation apps take sec to open i am expecting optimization over next updates usb ports doesn t support fat memory sticks pendrive hard disk or phone i am disappointed for this one max viewing distance can be feet my vision is for both eyes though google play store is given you cannot install even google chrome i see only chinese apps are available even in google play store don t expect to install apps just like you do it on smart phone no issue with remote and response time is good too remote build quality is good too no heating issues noted so far supports only ghz band wifi no manual power switch if remote doesn t work it will be a hell with tv chromecast has sec delay which is very bad if you connect with laptop and work with mouse touch pad suggestion if price is not a issue go for samsung or lg suggestion want to enjoy premium experience buy premium tv do not expect to find it from chinese brands time is money the more time you spend in exploring the options and unboxing videos in youtube consider adding that amount to the tv you buy hope my review will be a help brilliant tv at affordable price first sale tv was returned back as it was defective one brought it nd time it s totally worth it the media could not be loaded product is on price k inch y pros nice picture quality awsm dolby surround soundno problem with casting with you tubecons croma cast from mobile laging connect app not working data saver not available in y after days after dwnlg oxygen plan from play store croma cast is working without laging connect app is also working now data saver not found to y one star because of poor installation servicei ve received a call of installation guy at am he said he ll be at location after hour so i said ok please come waiting of him after hours he didn t came stop picking the call suddenly after half n hour again i received the call he asked sir did engineer call you visit your place i saidhl he called me at am but he didn t come even not picking my call i m trying him alot after long conversation of half n hour he arranged another guy he gaves me the contact of another guy again i ve called him he is saying sir i ll be there after hour which is completely hard for me too wait i was getting late for office as you know the problem of covid offices fire there s worker well after talk to with him i ve send him location again he called me after hour said sorry i m not coming o asked why guy s word was talk to my boss brother who is your boss i would i know again after min i ve received call again sir i m visiting your place for installation i was surprised that whole amazon company engineers visiting my home well again min he called me said sir i m not coming wtf this whole scene was of am to pm then finally engineer came pm installated the led the whole wait was of only screws wow amazon please improve your service which is totally sucks i ve missed my office led performance is good but the speaker sound is not up to the marks picture quality is good tv is awesome at this price among all the competitors in this range of tv oneplus tv is best viewing experience sound performance fluenceall this upto mark i m giving star because of the following reason oneplus connect app is not working with tv i m unable to find any datasaver option available storage is less was eagerly waiting for this tv it s economically priced and i got it for k super thin and lite weight thin bezels and a absolute delight audio for a small room is great bigger room it seems to be quiet less been using it whole day just that one plus connect didn t work with my iphone and content from pendrive also not viewable at all not sure if it s supposed to be like that or there is some issue with the product called one plus customer care who told one plus connect won t work for ios and suggested to long press the home button and select one plus server to connect android and to my surprise ios also can get connected and works flawlessly moving on to the pen drive issue after a lot of research trial and errors it works only on the format fat the video quality is good but sound quality is average with marginal noise on higher volume i have viewed online content and seen dth tv they gives true colors and you will truly love it dolby sound quality is enough even for living room for dth opt for a dolby supported settop box i am using airtel xtream box k which is only for airtel thanks customer software lags at times and when you select live tv at times it will not start and gets back to homescreen was able to mirror cast through oneplus connect oneplus connect app helps to use mobile as remote after the initial update the viewing angles are ok but this is va panel so nothing like ips panel oneplus has done good job with regards to video quality as it gives dci p color gamut google assistant works fine too the best thing is the customer service oneplus offers which is top notch and they listen to you with patience after sales matter and customer service matter alot in this era overall worthy contender bought during first sale on th july this tv is a blot on the name of one plus they shouldn t have launched any product with such poor quality picture quality is very poor colors doesn t look natural at all tried all the color settings may be good for a monitor but not definitely good as a tv sound quality is the biggest setback it sounds like a rd rate speaker and sound isn t balanced there is no clarity in the sound you won t be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen frame of tv isn t durable it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute summary don t expect anything good from this tv this product doesn t deserve the one plus brand name one plus should recall this product to maintain their brand image i would have returned this product if there was an option oneplus is settled for this cheap built quality it comes with plastic body screen is not at all good if you pressure you can see liquid like flowing which we see in cheap quality products sound is too worst in an olden days when you full the volume you can get bad sound with disturbance now you can experience same with this tv ordered on th and got it by th afternoon here s an honest review but before that here s a few tips for people who are going to buy it you ll get an echo dot only if you order it with the tv at the same time read the terms and conditions before leaving one star reviews because you didn t order the echo dot from your end and obviously didn t get it with the tv to use the one plus connect app you have to update the tv first the ota will be there when you turn on the tv for the first time after that open the connect server app on the tv and then open the connect app on the phone and it would work again do a little research before leaving negative reviews and confusing the potential buyers the type sync function use the phone to type on the tv through the connect app doesn t work as of now but would start working in the next app update head over to the community forum for the one plus tv to find more details if you talk about hardware the tv is flawless those who are complaining about the tv simply have a bigger room that the tv is designed for you can always buy a soundbar if you think the volume isn t sufficient for your room for me it s more than enough the display is top notch and the colors are vibrant it s truly bezel less and looks beautiful about the software there are a few misses here and there but i m sure it can be fixed through a software update screencast lags a lot i m waiting for an update to see if it s fixed to people who think that the tv lags a lot think of the tv as a phone with gb ram if you keep opening apps repeatedly in a short period of time the phone would lag same is the case with the tv it s a value for money for those who don t wanna spend a fortune to get a tv with a good display firstly i did not receive my amazon echo dot at no cost as promised so i m really pissed off however i liked the tv good in quality and sound is pretty loud too it s absolutely slim and sleek beautifully designed kudos to designed team easy to browse through apps and quick and easy to connect to phone especially one plus phones screen cast is just a click away gotta do some more research on one connect app it s giving me some hard time to connect to the tv i bought this tv in the first sale on th july and have been loving it amazon installation was prompt and it was set up the same day as the delivery it is pretty light and slim as given in the specs the picture quality is fabulous colors are right and everything about the display is better than normal as a normal user you wouldn t notice any point of complaint regards to display speakers are loud enough and we are bound to mostly use it at of the maximum volume dolby surrounds sound is an added benefit that does enhance the sound experience of the tv it runs android out of the box with oxygen play as the skin and the ui is pretty simple it automatically fetches major information from the apps that you add to the home screen given you have signed in if required the animations and transitions between application is sleek and there is no lag whatsoever if you have used an android phone the ui is no alien and the navigation will seem very familiar the connectivity ports provided are ample and the wifi reception is also pretty strong i don t know about the bells and whistles that other tvs come equipped with but as a normal user who wants to enjoy his shows videos and cinema on a smart tv from all the contemporary sources like prime video netflix youtube etc this is the perfect option it just got delivered on the second day of sale fixed also installation was done above feet sound quality is not good remote is not actual bluetooth as it doesn t sense with this price range we could have gone with the other brands only buy if you are lover other wise its not worth i have purchased this tv within few minutes of the sale and completely unsatisfied with the product i received the delivery was on time and had installed but none of the wireless connectivity is working like wi fi was not getting connected to the tv and could not connect the remote through the bluetooth feature the external view looks beautiful the tv screen view was not that great i want replacement aeap awaiting for your reply google assistant not working complaint times no solution pros price reputable brand good sound qualitycons over hyped average picture qualityconclusion what you pay for is what you get don t make the same mistake i made and fall for the way oneplus markets it tv responding to remote control is very slow due to gb of ram first impressions pretty smooth and on time delivery easy to configure impressive oneplus connect app game mode os chromecast bit low at audio part nothing more can be expected with w speakers overall supported video formats and features will be updated soon received a damaged tv with led panel visible from outside on edges amazon technician visited site and informed tv is defective but amazon rejected replacement saying item is not available and informed me to issue refund for an amount of for the tv where actually i paid rs for the order they said echo dot is free with this product when bought together on the first sale but they adjusted k to echo dot even they said its for free if bought together and even after days and sales over after that they are still saying that replacement is not available clear case of cheating i have prebooked the tv before the launch of it only and still amazon is not even taking care of things and rejecting replacement the picture quality and sound quality are good but the problem lies with the remote the remote becomes non responsive after some time of inactivity and it starts working only after a good mins adding to this the oneplus customer support is even poor i waited for mins just to get a message stating that no agents are available this was not expected from oneplus maybe because of the high expectations i had hence my greater disappointment it s an ok panel at best nothing too mind blowing system lag is definitely noticeable and the picture is slightly oversaturated but of course this is a budget tv and if you go for more expensive models of sony samsung and lg you will have a better viewing experience everything else is fine subpar at best save up a little more if you can and go for more premium brands taste is subjective and if you re on a budget this wouldn t be the worst option either tv excellent but tv installation very very very bad not come any call and massage now me open tv tv quality is not great at all the noise disturbance is way too much color options are very limited and way too saturated also they did not provide any echo dot even though it was written that it would be offered free of cost along with oneplus y neither at the time of purchase they mentioned about it later they added the process read everything before making a purchase of this disappointment based on a real incident at first remote s down arrow button was not working i was so not in a good mood i hit the remote with my hand just like all indians do it started working the media could not be loaded no doubt tv is value for money but has few small issues it doesn t gets on with single press of power button on remote it is a bit slow because of gb ram sound quality is not a expected few people mentioned about not receiving free echo dot i got it for free just you need to add it to cart with tv and at checkout they will give a full discount for echo dot display quality is top notch even though it s fhd and for the sound quality i also had issue with it but first go in sound setting and turn on surround sound and dolby sound and then feel the real sound this tv can provide earlier i had an issue with tv not being able to turn on by remote but after reading the manual i cane to know that to turn on tv it uses ir blaster on remote like old days unlike bluetooth so u have to point it directly to the right bottom of the tv a splendid purchase for the price really happy and the display is really punchy and colour accurate again good quality product deliver by oneplus i m using mi tv past years with lot of lagging while app to launcher switch this tv has no problem faced still now remote working smoothly picture quality good if u switch dolby digital plus the sound quality of tv speakers is good also i connect ant sound bar to tv is amazing not great in mi tv after update oneplus connect and chromecast working awesome tv valuable your money u wont regret did a mistake of pre ordering it without even waiting for the review the picture quality is not that great the interface has too much lags audio quality is also not upto the mark but has some of the coolest features cannot complaint for k but expected a bit more improved product from oneplus i mean that s what they are known for their speed and it certainly lacks in this tv wast of money it s not a good tvsub standard product picture was just ok very slow interface sound is very awful if you look for a good tv pls only buy prominent brands tv very much disappointed with this purchase writing after a months review bought this tv as just to test amazing powerful small tv inch with nice picture quality it does what it says most importantly it works amazing with amazon prime hotstar etc many tvs in this segment claim to be smart but fail to perform surprisingly tv tv is indeed a powerhouse which works without any lag amazing work by oneplus with just gb ram honestly speaking no tv can offer what this tv is offering in this price range i have nothing to complain about this tv when picture move fast then this tv not handel picture quality this tv sell without basic testing on news channel button of tv news headline moving not handel blur brightness feel your eye bad investment or k more and buy lg tv honest review after using for days i received the tv on the date mentioned inspite of the travel restrictions as my address was listed in a containment zone good job by the amazon delivery in kollam kerala the product is really worth the money you spend all features mentioned work you just have to update it first picture quality is excellent chromecast screencast works fine oneplus connect works you have to follow the instructions in the app all apps are working fine hotstar youtube amazon prime netflix you can connect the echo dot to this television and it works perfectly fine sound quality is more than average compared to the negative reviews that have been mentioned it is more than enough for the television it will depend vary on the platform you are using to view the videos the wall mount was installed by the service staff and they came at the correct time as agreed overalli am more than happy with the product i was a bit skeptical about the product after ready all the negative reviews but i have received a good product and it meets all the specifications mentioned by oneplus great job by oneplus in coming up with a budget tv picture and quality is ok but not work of smart phone mirror link function and smart phone as a remote function as i tried as per given instructions but not work many times hang the tv needs to restart by power cut and then on i recently purchased this tv in amazon flash sale for k and got a amazon echo dot along side with the tv also pre ordering the tv made may to additional year of warranty so that was a terrific purchase which intotal made a pretty good deal prosthe tv built was average looks great display was crisp picture quality excellent android is smooth for now sound quality adequate for my use remote wifi chromecast bluetooth works fine cons low internal storageno aux portoverall a deal that can be recommended and will deliver satisfaction not price worthy its better to buy y than this there are too many problems the screen is so laggy and the sound quality is too poor also take time to work for some task and also if you plug in any external drive it says to fromat build quality is superb for this price range pic quality is similar to full hd there is no much difference like hd ready utube n other online streaming content clarity is good there is no data saving alert this can be used as a secondary bedroom tv sound is okay u can connect it with external speakers little lag while moving through apps but that s not an big issue jus give sometime to load we r dealing with gb ram and budget processor wall mount for this tv is not included better u itself buy wall mount stand in local wall mount cost me rs for a k tv amazon please set a standard price for installation and let it be visible for us while ordering really frustrated by receiving a cheap local made wall mount for rs from the installater initially my wallmount amount was refunded by the technician now he got it back after a month the happy purchase of mine is now turned horrible i reduce all the stars just for installation and the awesome service u have provided tvse service experiencing issues as tv remote is not working at all and till now no engineer has came to install the tv the oneplus tv screen just go black after using for day the worst quality tv they have made which caused the tv dis functioning with in just a single day i want to return this please help me to get this tv returned and refund my money back to my account review the launched was much awaited for as soon as the sale for inch was out we booked the tv the addition of the amazon echo dot was the cherry on top of the cake the tv arrived the next day in good condition observations for this price the tv has an elegant look the bezeless display does indeed live up to its mark as per my calculations which includes the bottom logo bar as well the display screen amounts to of the total display image quality is indeed amazing the colours are vibrant images truly standout when fed with a p input the display does pure justice to k youtube videos audio quality for this price segment yields no complaints however you will need a sound bar or home theater system if you want to enjoy the video with bass powered sound the tv promises dolby audio but lacks bass obviously due to sound physics as it does not have a woofer but still satisfies for a medium sized living room inputs are adequate taking into consideration the present technological advancements hdmi inputs for your stb gaming console however a rd hdmi would have been great to have as spare to connect to a laptop no really needed though as the tv comes with built in chromecast for screen mirroring i would rate the os response out as there is some minor lag when using the os when i received the tv i installed the mb update dated jun but i believe there should be another update which should improve the os performance and fix some bugs within a bug being the os is unable to handle a non arc hdmi device well i enabled the hdmi arc service not knowing that my stb does not support arc due to this there is a blue rotating loading circle constantly turning on my display when on hdmi input of course disabling this service gets rid of the blue circle but for oneplus it would be nice to see a popup stating that the input device does not support arc rather than have a constant blue circle on the screen also my os still does not have the data saver feature which many users have stated that they do not see on their tv s so anxiously waiting for the next ota update as many users are raised the issue heavy lag while using screen cast mirroring hoping again then the ota update would fix this tv remote functions purely on bluetooth the remote is compact has a minimalist design the best part being the remote has dedicated buttons for ott apps netflix prime youtube a drawback i see in the remote is due to it being purely bluetooth i no longer can use my universal remote for my tv also i believe there is a bug in the remote which does not let you switch on the tv instantly sometimes you have the press the power button a few times clearly visible on the red flashing led on the remote hoping ota will fix this issue too another issue my suggestion with the remote is that it misses the input source button this missing button makes it extremely difficult for my not so technologically advanced mother to switch between inputs another thing that surprises me is that there is a dedicated amazon prime video button on my remote but no inbuilt alexa integration i have to use a skill on alexa but unfortunately like many other people i haven t been able to connect my oneplus tv to my alexa account this makes the supplied echo dot useless as i cannot use the echo dot to wake up my tv via voice command yet to try google assistant but i want alexa functioning as my other devices are synced with alexa if you are reading this point and have been able to integrate your oneplus tv to your amazon account then please leave me an answer on my question the last point being i am not sure if its a design flaw or a shipping mishap but the topleft topright corners seem to be either damaged or poorly finished by the assembly team see images overall this product has so far satisfied me well i will certainly be writing another review when i have the ota update to fix some of the bugs add the missing features until then i will enjoy my oneplus tv lastly stars to amazon for providing the option of year extended warranty for inr and automatically adding it to my oneplus after days of arrival in addition just as promised returing me the inr back as amazon pay balance such offers keep customers like me happy menu button not working since day one volume getting high and low suddenly on its own need to watch tv with remote in hand to control sudden change in volume as per the tv engineer this issue is with all oneplus tvs and it cannot be resolved also the echo dot device doesnt work with this tv as of now tv looks awesomebut i suggest you don t buy this p panel tvgo for atlest full hd tv if you cancoz picture quality is not so goodatlest buy any full hd tv great picture qualitysuperb dolby soundnice oxygen app well performedmy family is very happy to see in this tvi have inch another company tv but colour combinations in this tv is great we r very happy with one plusdon t follow bad commentsplease go with this tvi m using it and give u best review product delivered on th july but almost days gone installation is not done by qdigi and no support by amazon add clearly says it is along with eco dot worth of but it is not there is separate procedure to avail it if this is a free why one more procedure required it is eye wash to customer this tv not working with alexa keep your mind before purchase dolby sound is fantastic you will get awesome movie experience picture quality is also good tv remote also working good little lag but it s fine amazon tv installation service tooooo much bad not on time always days let don t accept they will do at the time amazone delivery at time time no dout about delivery system too good i m trust on oneplus blindly never settle overall tv experience is amazing we loving it quite good product for the price product is light weight and looks very delicate colors are beautiful sound system is also great with dolby but the main problem i found is the speakers are located at bottom so if you place if on a table the sound won t be clear i m facing the same issue now but if you are going for wall mount option then go for it neither of the competitors can give you the best colour viewing experience sound is too bad and you will literally cry for that picture quality is okayish and software is good forget about oneplus connect feature one word review oneplus tv y series is not good baught oneplus tvpros picture quality is exellent even better than my previous sony and lloyd tv s even though it is hd ready panel not the full hd but if you watch it from feet distance the display look crisp and clearsound is very loud and clearand with the support of dolby atmos and surround sound it feels like a theater experience in small roomui is as smooth as oxygen os on oneplus phonesbezzals are very thin infact the thinnest in sagmentcons there s no wall mount with the tv inside the box or out of the box if you are from small city or village area there s no installation service provided by amazonthere s no data saver option in inch modeloverall after comparing with my previous tv s and considering the price of just the tv gives you more value than the money you are payingfeels like tv or even morewill buy more oneplus tvs in next sale picture colour blinking after days disconnect automatically from wifi network tv is very nice but amazon installation service very bad installation price and late days bad installation unpurfasonal engg i feel greatful to get such opportunity to review this product this is my first time attachment to oneplus and its truely great now talk about this product all the features are great and picture quality is mindblowing but there are some disappointment in sound system it should be better but at this price range i cant expect more if you can attach a sound system to this then it will be a remarkable product at this price the video and sound quality are awesome you will truly love it dolby sound quality is enough to even for the living room for dth opt for a dolby supported set top box software optimization is top notch was able to mirror cast oneplus connect app helps to use mobile as remote after the initial update the viewing angles are great for a va panel oneplus has done a good job with regards to video quality as it gives dci p color gamut and feels of full hd tv google assistant works fine too the best thing is the customer service oneplus offers which is top notch and they listen to you with patience after sales matter and customer service matter a lot in this era overall satisfied when i purchased this tv there is a offer of eco dot is free with it but they do legal fraud with customers which we can t do any think even when i said to customer center for writing complaint but they said we can t write complaint bcz we didn t violet terms and conditions it s really bad from amazon india but about one plus tv picture quality is much better sound is ok ok over all tv is good with this price range average picture qualitybelow average sound qualitysometimes lagy software hope fix next update no issue on

product again from oneplus picture quality is superb screen size and picture ratio is best in this range sound quality is ok when u compare it with vu cinema which have w speakers but all in all nice tv in this range from oneplus it could not even run for days and now i am not getting a refund replacement update after using for more than a month very late response and also laggy device kindly think before buying this one i have oneplus mobile still doesn t work hassle free it s too slow remote response is almos second late no wall mount was provided by the oneplus nor was available with the installation team had to use my old wall mount all over happy pls mention for wall mount additional charges if required before the installation guy comes display quality is excellentsound is okconnectivity with ott apps are little bit slowno screen mirror option only chrome cast but you can do the job with an additional device via hdmi portfinally to say worth for price in this segmenttv installation service become a bit challenge in my area quite satisfied with the product for the price range for people complainting about lag issue its nothing to do with ram ir storage just pair the remote with bluetooth by default remote works with ir which needs a straight line of sight once you pair it as bluetooth it works like a charm to pair the remote with bluetooth just go to setting in tv and click on remote and accessories adter that click left and home key simultaneously on remote it will be paired and no lag issue will be there the media could not be loaded loving the picture quality and the thin bezels wasn t expecting great sound from the reviews but am surprisingly satisfied from the output for my room all the os features working after the update oneplus connect was not that useful till now the remote is nice after installation of nd day that black line was on screen its faulty pic worth buying for k as you get echo dot free with this the best in class tv for and in inch catagory it s the best value for money the package and the built in quality is just oneplus go for it if you are look for the inch catagory this is a must buy i ll use some more days and update some details first impressions picture quality is top notch bezel less design and worth for money sound quality is decent for the price product delivery and installation was on time will update the usage review after a month very good picture quality dolby sound is very nice wifi and bluetooth connectivity is very fast edge display remote is very smart i thought oneplus is showing fake bezels on this tv in their advertising material like other brands do but in real also they r thin tv is perfect superb smart tv at very affordable price the best installetion support update are quick the best picture quality and does not require any external soundbar the apps opens quick and googel assistant is best on remote made in india country of origin also india the media could not be loaded it s bad that it doesn t hav a data saver that is one good feature it must be added after two days the tv is not getting on showing lik above video it might be a manufacturing defect if fixed den it is good tv the product i received was defective the installation executive came to my premises and submitted a job sheet to amazon mentioning its defective the panel did not switch on i guess i was the most unluckiest person to receive the defective product expected more of plus tv very bad experience initially hope i get my replacement tv soon i request amazon to expedite the process i waited nearly a week to receive the product another couple of days for the installation person to open it and declare it as defective how long should it take for the replacement and how long for the service person to open the box and install the tv from it s original packing i heard that oneplus products have their separate identity so i decided let take a chance i got it on next day of sale i e on th of july till then installation was pending now it get done on th of july that s ht long time but i must tell you after the starting the tv that s the masterpiece i ever saw all things you need is in that you connect surf whatever you want overall awesome tv my whole family is happy with that the media could not be loaded just after day of use screen started to flicker which at first i thought might be connection issue or just a passing thing but by the next day you can see the reference video and by all this time showing faith on the brand got me into trouble as days were done now then the real game started i got to taste the real service by customer support haha it all started with simple sweet talk no problem sir we will get it done attitude then came i have to talk to my executive then there is a form to be filled out and you will get a revert then passing it to the so called concerned team and then they were like we need a technician to visit and see what s the problem as if video was not enough still ok then came the game of passing the responsibility amazon s technician talk to amazon and they will send in the replacement amazon we don t have authority to give a replacement oneplus needs to do it talk to their support andthen oneplus doing the same stuff on repeat mode no response to email even after days had to wait for chat for hr to talk to esteemed oneplus chat service again some sweet talk will revert to you in hrs then called oneplus and they again said amazon will do we can t great service and great companies update yet to get a solution hahaha getting mad laughing just an awesome tv at this price point it does has some limitations and lags but at this price point no complaints it s better than all the other brands available at this price good picture quality unfortunately returning only due to the presence of some horizontal lines on the screen otherwise excellent product for this price tv is excellent but for installation called many times and after many calls on rd time resheduling installation done otherwise stars from my side very cheap in built quality i am disappointed with oneplus never expecte this type or of products launch by oneplus excellent and satisfied with the tv sound quality was amazing and installation was done after days intially the tv was slow when connected to internet later it was working normally the screen casting also very fast and finally thanks to the installation team for installing the tv before intial scheduled appointment first of all you have to change the picture settings and then boom the display is amazing and the dolby sound is very loud as i thought about a must buy product thanku amazon for this beauty product is average plastic material is not good booting up is fast applications like amazon prime do es not work properly sometimes it is okay for ppl who uses only for dish tv purpose android version is not up to the mark led screen is okay average product okay for the price given no alexa support and oneplus customer care even don t know if this y series tv support alexa or not amazingsound is really poor and os issues as it s lags so much sec window after pressing remote button good picture quality with apps and games but when check with normal sd channel it s really poor overall don t expect any support from oneplus customer care they are pathetic called times in last days and still they are checking alexa issue strange na data saver is must needed for tvs when streaming services like netflix and prime video doesn t allow you change the streaming quality it streams by default at fhd p consuming around gb hourly i stopped watching at all i thought oneplus would include data saver in their y series as well but they didn t and it s their in u and q series the tv is gorgeous in terms of hardware and picture quality i d say best in class i hope they ll added it in next update also the oneplusconnect app doesn t work at all thanks oneplus picture quality good sound average connectivy the packaging was simple and easy to unpack as mentioned in the description the packaging includes tv remote user manual warranty included aaa battery wall mount is not included the tv is very slim light weighted and easy to setup display looks good sound is fine operating the tv is easy too audio stopped working after days and one plus is not supporting and asking to contact amazon not sure who will help with this one of problems buying online products full hd p video picture good sometimes remote is not responding well sound could ve been better new app install update uninstall are very easy also have some pre installed app which is not uninstallable overall good tv better than mi this product is very good and excellent sound quality don go with the negative review this product is just awesomethe review in youtube and other social media platforms are totally wrong i personally used this tv i got y last wednesday itself came in good package no issues with amazon or oneplus packages picture and sound is dope even it connected easily with my lan and phone the tv is good for the price you pay we things that i would like to suggest bring it to notice this not yet compatible with alexa sound output is average would recommend a sound bar to enhance sound quality try blaunpaunkt sb picture quality is good few backlight bleeds you will need to set it to correct color setting to have a good viewing experiencerest is good hoping oneplus would give ota updates to resolve few things it s disappointing to see that sound was not something one plus put their efforts to improve fortunately i didn t get a laggy tv mine works fine although power on and off with the remote is tricky and build quality is the lowest i expected there are haps everywhere very low quality body have to be very fragile while moving it although having these problems i don t think i will return the product but still to play a game with a brand image of one plus it really did some damage this time i won t recommend this if you are saving up for an immersive experience it lacks some of the basics of tv requirment great deal although little bit disappointed for speaker but in this price range its worth ittips buy prime membership before buying this tv its worth it the first time i m writing against one plus the way one plus brand its image is great but when it comes to television section it s worst it s just days y series w inches tv has gone wrong with its technical issues where the wifi is not getting connected smart tv without wifi connectivity is as waste as it is after raising complaint to one plus tv days back yet no one responded i suggest everyone s go ahead with mi better price best quality as my cousin uses it from one long year amazon was best at service recently even it turned out to be worst after delivery of defect product still amazon wabt back up and make customer feel terrible on service as returns the product amazon dosent have option to retun money abd they won t pace up in service too post collection of tv amazon tele representative says it will take days to get deliver new one i dint understand why i ve to wait after paying k and getting defective amazon tele representative says be patience cos of this guy s service it s creating mental agony worst service from amazon and worst product from one plus two big brands loosing their image great picture quality good sound lacks the bass effect but dolby audio enhances the sound best tv in the price segment don t think twice just go for it product is made in india picture quality super sound super connectivity super no buffering prime or netflix or youtube feels like theatre experiencewon t work proper with oneplus phone to oneplus tv lags too muchworth buying picture quality is best with super colorssound is not upto the mark tried bass but it s ok for w also tried surround sound it s ok checked screen cast lil bit of delay in it hope you find this helpful excellent features and working also perfect best tv on budget simply buy it i got this tv on th sept after days both the hdmi ports stopped working i have initiated the warranty claim by amazon three times but it has been days and no one came to repair the tv worst service by amazon i am a prime customer but now i regret talking to a lot of people and asking them to visit amazon to give honest reviews on all the products there is a lot going behind the bars now and quality has reduced drastically best tv at this price available in market no complaints about it every thing is good and fantastic only thing is you need oneplus or apple device to connect to oxygen play but you can also access it on the tv so no issues the media could not be loaded everything is just perfect except sound quality bass lovers should buy soundbar to experience this amazing product best pricegood picturegood screeni hate soundsspeaker not goodtemple speaker thu simple and nice tv with loads of features in small budget happy with the quality and performance thank you amazon and one plus for delivering the best beast tv everything is just amazing only oneplus connect is useless but it s ok when you have normal remote you really don t need that stupid application please go ahead and buy it you can trust amazon and the installation company to help you during any ups and down they are really helpful installation is free and wallmount is also free you don t have to pay rupee also if you don t ask them to put new switch board or wiring or something they will come drill holes and put the mount and will go simple and easy the media could not be loaded bought this product on october tv was quite impressive in the beginning and picture quality was also good on april tv screen got black sounds are coming but no visual technician told panel issue it s been months but my tv problem is not yet resolved let s see whether tv will be repaired or not under warranty duration i hope amazon will help me out asap oneplus amazon qdigii will update my feedback guys about warranty promises shared by oneplus group whether it is real or painful i hope i will not lose my trust from oneplus brand they will sort this out and help me too thanksabhishek got defective pc the same has been informed the tv installer dead pixel and damaged on bezel don t purchase this after using couple of weeks i am writing this review my opiniononeplus tv is similar in to mi tv vu tv realme tv motorola tv in terms of functions and performance there is no brand mark on the tv i am neither happy nor sad don t wait for the flash sale go for any tv all are same didnt expect from oneplus bad sound quality lags aftr days appers lines on tv i cant return tv bcoz return period is over very worst build please dont buy remote conectivity is slow and sound clarity is some less rather than tv is amazing super extraordinary tv nice in budget too slow with lag due to less ram did not expected this from oneplus avoid buying this one overall it s a good tv for the price i got the tv echo dot and years of warranty i did find it a bit laggg initially but seemed better after the first update the wall mount took an additional like this tv very much better picture quality good sound and connection floor stand distance is high so couldn t accommodate in my small tv table sometimes prime get restart automatically otherwise it s a pakka product thumbs up for timely delivery and installation for amazon review after days picture quality is good and for the price is great as got rs echo dot and years extended warranty it s looking very good till now however i installed it on my own installation is pretty late by delivery tv is looking great physically and also its interface easy to useonly one problem i am facing that is connecting the tv to the settop box through hdmi port always mute the audio after power on but hdmi arc port is working fine also i cannot control the volume of the tv in the settop box using settop box remote on dolby mode i purchased this only for the brand name you get a woww factor when you say you have one plus tv other than that it is pretty normal tv for this price range you get cheaper k tv from thompson mi and vu for this price range so you are actually paying k for this brand value and nothing else as the specs and performance match with other tv brands display quality is very good and sound could have been better these are on par with other tv on this same price range down firing speakers make sound little muffled casting works perfectly in both android and iphone airtel xrteam or jio live tv app is not available for any tv models but you can run it on phone and cast it to tv so you don t have to purchase a dth or cable with smart tv with built in chromecast tv does become slow when you open multiple apps but this is problem in all budget tv models hdmi ports is not a problem at all as mostly you would only use ports for dth and for playstation since moving to ott we no more use dvd or blue ray players also chromecast is inbuilt so there is really no need for rd hdmi cable nice productpicture quality is awesomein budget of k it s good to buy and u get echo dot freeand if u purchase the extra waranty it is free with itif u don t add echo dot while purchasing then u will not recieve with tv u have to add to cart during purchasing with tv then checkout for paymentscreen cast is laggy sound quality is ok great product at after card discount amazing panel and color depth go

concentration to hear sound to understand the words design design is goodremote remote is also goodneed an update to fix this issue but if it is a lcd tv then no update can fix the picture quality of this tv hope for the best this is fantastic tv ever please do not trust any bad review i personally loving it there is not any lag issue very slim and best tv under k the media could not be loaded i am a oneplus user since never expected these sort of cheap quality product from oneplus tv stopped working after months display is blank now oneplus service is pathetic they are not responding even weeks after raising the complaint don t waste money on this crap expected a lot but basic things not functioning the jio g connection doesn t get listed and hence cannot be selected the connect app doesn t connect though chromecast is available i have been unable to cast anything sound is not smooth remote sensitivity is very low when compare to mi tv its ver hard for me to change the channel had an extremely poor experience with oneplus tv tv screen turns black on random occasions but frequently it again turns back on in sec to min sounds stops working similarly picture turns green randomly this doesn t feel like a oneplus product even local brands provide better products after all this i applied for replacement and then amazon scheduled an inspection service and the inspection guy didn t show up had to rescheduled it two more times but no one shows up contacted amazon and told the whole scenario then they replaced it directly got the replaced product but the issues are still there and this time the product feels like second hand only that this time the issues ka worse and more frequent that last one filed a return request again got inpection service scheduled and after explaining previous experience to customer care this time got a call from inspection guy he made a video of the issue he said that he has verified the issue but i did not receive any response from amazon regarding this and the worse thing amazon is not providing customer care support now tried multiple times but didn t recieve any call from amazon feeling stuck with this defective product won t be using amazon for a long time now update after initiating the return order again amazon sent people for picking up the defective item now waiting for refund initiation excellent picture quality best primium look the media could not be loaded i m one oneplus fan always tv in this low bedget is very good sound quality need improvement picture quality is good and over all value for money good product worth buying at this price point picture quality is awesome sound is good but no bass bezzle less design is good worth buying at this price the media could not be loaded it s awesome tv at k except for viewing angles it s color production and lookwise it s unmatchable from front on it matches any full hd tv interface is smooth color production is really good blacks are really black like oled panelfrom sides it s colors fade is noticable it s the only but big negative from onepluswhen it comes to sound it is good while streaming through apps like youtube hotstar with set of box it s bit low no lag in os remote is easy to operate and premium look after months usage it s going great and really satisfiedafter almost year usage i m satisfied with this tv picture quality is of high class one issue noticeable is there is a mm gap at the base frame not a major concern but oneplus need to take care if you are using it only with set of box use a good hdmi cable it will really enhances viewing experience with av cables you will get very poor picture quality it s one year of moderate use but i m getting back light issues on screen currently it s not a issue while watching but if it continues to intensity it will be a issue i didn t expect that within a year the media could not be loaded respected viewer i know before purchasing this expensive leisure you will be viewing the rewievs let me tell you this tv has a great picture quality and smart features but this crashed in just days of use i purchased this tv long time back and it was kept in one corner of my house and then after a hell lot of scams one fine day a totally unprofessional fellow came to install it after damaging the whole wall with innumerable drills he installed it and didn t even explain the features which somehow we got to know about then he charged the double price for the wall mount then after thousands of complaints finally we got a refund would suggest to buy from a showroom hope you find it helpful but informally would like to tell if you don t want to fall in any sort of problem then please don t purchase this product have a good day wonderful picture quality easy to operate but one plus connect app doesn t work volume is not that much but it s worth it for the price it comes under price is reasonable picture quality is good connectivity also good remote is small and good sound is ok need to explore more bazzle is almost negligible looks good in this price you can t ask for more awesome picture quality a bit slow operating system else everything is good just amazing best in the segmentno competition with thisgreat colors and bezel less display amazing oneplus tv is best but amazon courier faciliti is very very bad i am very irritating for wating this product for this much price we can say tv is good in every aspect but there is a lagging problem it s taking time to open any app i am not too happy with this one i had huge expectations too much of led bleeding issues and patches across the panel i am awaiting an inspection from amazon so hoping for a replacement soon initial overview price wise a good deal if my panel issue gets resolved but if you don t consider the price this comes nowhere near to a samsung panel the most horrible thing about this tv is its remote control very much irritating you to press the button times to change something not expected this from one plus although this tv has a good picture quality average sound clarity and a decent bezel less display it can be said a value for money product but the remote connectivity and performance is awful waiting since last year for in tv finally able to purchase more value for less money happy with product value for money screen is bit delicate except tht everything is fine awesome design so far so good if you re going to purchase this product make sure you have atleast gb day data plan dedicated to this tv also you need a wifi router for getting full functionality let me start with the pros picture quality is great you ll need some tweeks though set it on movie preset for day time use energy saving for night time use i reduced backlight to and it s in user mode to reduce eye strain audio quality is good you also need a lot of tweeks though set it in movie preset if you re watching movies this preset let s you hear all the music details also you ll hear the dialogues crystal clear in this mode you won t hear bass that much you ll get a hint of base nothing much because base will affect the dialogues set it in music preset if you re listening to music in this preset you ll hear all the highs and lows crystal clear you ll get bass as well okay now discuss about the conseverything else in this tv is a con it has data saver installed but you can t able to access it data savers has an update in playstore for some reason it s not updating you can t use this tv as a bluetooth speaker you have to cast your phone screen in order to play your music on tv screen which brings a lot of problems first you need a wifi router with gb data dedicated to this tv for casting only because it s using chromecast not miracast so what happens is you are sharing your mobile screen to your tv using mobile data even though it s on same network which is stupid why in the world i have to spend my data to transfer the data packets using my router it s on same network for god s sake also while casting if you open youtube in your phone it opens youtube app on tv so you ll end up spending x data for playing youtube video for playing in mobile for transferring data to tv and for the video playing on tv but fellow competitors like mi tv also have built in chromecast only i don t know any budget tv which supports miracast if you knew comment below to let me know it can only access hard disc upto tb some apps like udemy are not supported on this tv you re going to spend more money on ott let me explain how if you re going to use netflix on tv you ll need premium subscription to add devices at a time also if you have airtel xstreme on your phone and thinking i can use airtel xstreme on tv you re wrong you need to purchase xstreme for tv as well if you re rich enough to purchase all ott platforms and have enough money to spend gb day data on tv on regular basis you ll love this tv otherwise you re gonna end up hating this tv and yourself for purchasing this tv i chose to purchase this tv because it s an android tv also home services during warranty period is free i don t have to take this tv to the service centre if there s something s wrong after warranty period they charge for the service which is cheaper than other brand but if i knew i m gonna get this for k i wouldn t even think about purchasing this tv because i got these picture and audio in my old sansui lcd tv which lasted years without any issues excellent tv picture quality superb for sounds i will give for connectivity overall excellent tv in low budget better than others brands outstanding i love it nuch better then mi led good in this price awesome product superb audio n video really experienced with k video n dolby audio but google chrome not installed in this i booked repair service by oneplus care app no one come and update the status too many time tried to contacting customer care of oneplus no acknowledgment and tried booked by amazon warranty services no one come on appointment date they reschedule the appointment without contact me this is very bad service bhai log this is suvi from nagpur maharashtra bro tv is all good no lags no nothing very good picture quality good sound and worth buying it if you are buying it for home use purposes all those glitches and lags are just because of wifi speed in order to use this tv at high speed u must have high speed internet available or else for tv serial use it is all good go on with it i have used mi and one pluspros picture quality one plus is better sound quality one is bettercons lags heavily while changing ott and switch on off this too much annoying never expected this due to this sometime in the background last played will continue for few seconds it spoiled entire mood and concept of good quality tv mi is much better there is not much lag remote design absolutely poor engineering remote design it s not handy to use hold and stupid placement of keys in the remote made poor engineering design products as compared mi is far better simple sleek and to the target time to switch on takes more than usual time it s honest review not filters i purchased inch tv and having best bezeless tv experience you will find in this price range premium built video quality is simply awesome with dolby audio value for money worth it i ve got internal storage of gb and here is mentioned gb of storage can i know why i bought this tv in april and it stopped working within a month okay that s fine it can happen with any product right it took almost months to get a service guy that s also fine even though i had no entertainment at home because of the lockdown going on everywhere all of sudden a service guy came like an angel and said i have to pay for the service as the board is burned it won t comes under their warranty policy great i have been using a vu tv for the past years that too got damaged but replaced with a brand new tv twice without even any questions asked it was my great mistake i thought oneplus would provide quality products and quality services they just su k the tv is an okay ish buy don t come for the brand here i would happily suggest anyone to go with a samsung or even onida tv which does come at a nearby price point the sound is low but what to expect from a watt internal speaker even though it is back lit with led there are certain points where you will not be able to see anything it will be pitch black while it should have been normal and for the game mode i used my ps xbox one and switch along with that played a couple of matches in battlefield and wwii it reduces lag but not upto a gaming level the remote cannot start the tv all the time it is slow when it comes to remote response but that is only for the start up but at this price point what can one expect and at the time of writing this review i had a serious issue a few days back but the inputs from hdmi produced a grayscale output i thought the tv was done for but it happens across all the oneplus tv s it seems if anyone has the same issue reset the entire tv i wasted some time with amazon and oneplus care by scheduling repair services but it was no good all in all i love one plus despite the negative points stated the above has stars for amazon and for the tv if you want to try this one gladly you are welcome but i would suggest you to try another brand specifically well established ones like samsung or sony or tcl or onida picture quality not that much better but ok sound quality is good gud display audio output superb oneplus tv arrived my home todayit very slim and price was also good it was very slim and easy to handle i like one plus not china the media could not be loaded i bought this tv on october for inch it s almost a year now i m writing this review even after so many negative reviews i placed order on my own risk but its worth the order tv is fine working well as displayed ignore the negative reviews guy from amazon mounted on wall wellgood sound quality video quality everything is good i m really satisfied by plus display quality is bestsound enough for a medium sized hallscreen mirroring works without laggingconsgoogle voice search delays by seconds plus connect isn t so much interesting as it s too much slowbluetooth we can t connect our mobile but only tv with headset and bluetooth speakerso don t think of connecting mobile bluetoothoveralldisplay is awesomesound quality nicebass average i order the product on th july flash sale it is worth for this price and good picture and sound quality picture quality is amazing i have been using the inch y series for over a week now pros love the black tones the tv itself is very aesthetic latest android loaded all frequently used apps programs available in the tv the remote is very sleek and is bluetooth enabled no need to point remote to tv the delivery and installation services were very quick and efficient cons the os laga the build quality does not feel great plastic body doesn t work well with alexa sound quality is not great the colours are not great either does not have different picture colour modes the biggest con for me is that it does not have adaptive display and gets too bright in low light while in standard settings overall for the price of k k the tv is totally worth buying remember that this is a budget tv premium tv s are almost double the cost value for money got it delivered on exact date and installation done next day loved the product better then mi and realme i guess the media could not be loaded alright here is the new one plus tv y you can watch unboxing on my you tube channel x plorer i have been using this tv since a week now here are some pros and cons of the tv pros price yes being a indian we always seek products which are best quality with affordable price it fits well gift yes you get alexa dot with oneplus y and u tvs who don t like free stuff picture quality is super with baseless design of of total view viewing angel will give you great experience build quality i have been trying different tvs till now including mi inch iffalcon inch and other but trust me this one plus is far ahead when it comes to design and quality material cons sound yes it has wt output sound with dolby atmos but you won t feel bass ram it has gb ram with internal storage of gb out of which only around gb is useful this would make operation lit slow andoid oxygen play it s hardly has watchable content and it s too old as there is patch wall picture quality sound quality is up to mark blindly go with it i have used it for only day but my experience is awesome and i didn t felt any laggy experience with the tv everything other than installation is remarkable the tv s voice assistant features are almost non functional every time when i tried the voice command the ongoing video movie stuck the picture and sound quality are not so great for a room of sqft and there was a lot of glare even with less light in the room tried all the suggestions on changing contrast brightness etc by looking at the hype i expected a lot but this tv did not meet any of my expectations and left a disappointing experience too good purchase without hasitation only d problem is amazon late service n nothing else love it amazing picture qualitydoesn t lag only lag found was during initial setup w speaker with dolby speakers does a great jobbezels are extremely less and gives a nice experience oneplus did a great job and does give a premium feel cons audio quality should be tweaked no bass which is a huge disappointment alexa is not bundled you need to add it separately during the purchase amazon when you mention that alexa comes free with this purchase then make it bundled with the tv unit and do not ask customers to add it separately during the purchase don t expect the customers to add it separately during the flash sale this is simply cheating on the customers i don t get the original bill with box kindly provide me a softcopy of my bill sound quality is a bit poor remaining things are good delivery in time and installation was also in time overall good service apart from the screen size and the clarity and the sound ofcourse nothin in this is a good buy technically challengedevery time yo switch on the tv you need to have a separate network in which you connect it first then only you can connect it to your wifi pathetic response timeif incase you re in a bad mood then refrain from switching on this tv cuz it s going to be like solving a puzzle what went wrong what possibly can be right and after all of that the remote will give you a run which you never wanted i can go on but not worth my time just one thing if you think of buying cheap you can opt for tcl instead but these are just junk covered with a shiny plastic and a good outlook actually i went through all the comments and reviews i was initially intersted in oneplus but after reading these reviews i got confused then i checked for other smart tvs and finally settled to purchase this oneplus tv only because of the trust and experience i had on oneplus products mainly mobile phones which me and my family are using believe me after receiving this tv i couldn t understand why people are so critical about this it serves all the purpose very well all smart features are excellent connectivity is so good picture quality and sound is absolutely fine and sufficient for me people complaint about its picture sound quality but i found it amazing i don t expect any better clarity of picture than this tv and sound i couldn t use it on more than volume in my sq ft room guys it s just a tv it could be bad good or excellent for me it s excellent i am not looking for a wife here and people who are being so critical about this tv i don t know what are they were expecting may be they are comparing this tv with a pvr screen or its sound with a bose music system then definitely it s a below expectation product for you sorry for your loss value for money worst service ever it s just been days tht we bought it it was all working fine and all of a sudden it shut down and we were unable to switch it on that too no body touched it or did anything how can this happen quite surprised i d tried calling oneplus customer care they re saying they won t be able to replace it since we d purchased it from amazon and this seems to be too hectic to hear what s this amazon never expected this the quality of the service is pathetic please don t buy it from amazon for their eye catching offers it always good to go n buy from their own website i feel so if i would have done that then i would have got a replacement atleast i never expected from oneplus tv experience is with pictures quality and sound along with smart features picture quality very poor sounds is okay but don t bother as i have sound bar tv takes sec to start slow in operation like going back to previous series or jumping to other plateform slim and very light weight but how does it matter as it will be hand on the wall final comments dont buy or at least see few videos in youtube before buying for experts comments i was blind with oneplus name and mobile fan for past several years and now i will be sorry for very long time picture quality and sound quality is excellent biggest disappointment with this tv was that this tv doesn t support ghz wifi bandwidth it still supports the ghz which i realised after everything was setup overall the tv is good picture quality is good not great but assuming the tv is for only rs i wasn t expecting much sound again isn t top notch but loud enough you will have to customise the sound settings a bit or if you really want that sround sound kinda effect you may need to buy an additional sound bar the remote connection is good and everything else is fine begel less is awesomethat is a good in one plusgreater better oneplus is worth the money as always this tv at that price tag is really a competitor to many other brands the best points from this tv include smart features minimal bezel frame picture google voice assistant customer friendly settingsone thing i wasn t accepting from this is its sound i used a samsung smart tv before this and its output itself sounded as if it was from a home theatre but the same output from oneplus was pathetic i even tried all their settings and features available i then ordered a jbl infinity home theatre only for the sound thing and then connected it over bluetooth it was then beautiful and perfect but after a couple of days there was a lag between the tv sound output and that from the home theatre i then replaced the jbl thing from amazon and to my surprise found out that even the next one had a similar issue after a couple of days i m still worried if the bluetooth feature of oneplus tv has an issue or just my specific piece this review of mine doesn t judge oneplus tv at any side it s just my experience other than the bluetooth lag at some times everything is at it s best and you can go for it without a second thought having dark patches at the bottom edge of the screen asked for the replacement not the way it was expected disappointed edit after a week or so got the tv replaced this one piece is ok and thanks to the tech team listening and addressed the issue as early as possible still i have some issue why the bluetooth once paired for speaker doesn t stay forever every time i had to unpair and pair the bluetooth after switching off and on the tv it s so irritating rest i m ok with the it this has some issues it was slow since the day i bought it i had read that this is the way it is designed it is a slow tv fine by me i bought it like a dumb a now after few months it stucks manufacturing defects were never considered and repaired before a launch go for it on your own risk ps risking isn t worth on this one go sky diving if you wanna risk so much overall meets the expectations at this price good for the price you pay software is buggy but nothing s deal breaking here picture quality its decent slim bezels you ll find backlit led bleeding in on the side overall it s a good quality for what you pay audio its hard to hear dialogues in the movies ull be needing a decent external speakers for sure the tv looks really good with thin bezels this tv has some serious software issue until or unless they rectify the issue i would not recommend this tv but yah i hope it can be resolved by a software update takes time more than month i guess software issues when unboxed it was fine after some days the software is getting lag the screen is getting fully red sometimes like the display has damaged but after restart or re set the tv it is getting normalized picture quality is not too awesome but yah if you could adjust the picture settings its nice but not awesome good aspects the remote is awesome if you connect it with bluetooth its damn good if it s not its bit laggy if you are watching the cable dish you don t need to change the input always to hdmi composite it will read the last input when you switch back on oneplus connect is working fine but yah its laggy you can change the below steps movements left right up down and select change the inputs hdmi composite back button google voice is working fine can open the apps download etc the tv sound is great not a dolby one but yah its good bad aspects not able to connect with alexa echo dot rd gen i have checked with the service team they told its might be a software issue and they also told they will sent a guy to resolve this technichal guy is not yet came some time the screen is getting fully red got resolved after re setting its irritating sometimes to re set the tv again and again while purchasing the tv the alexa echo dot rd gen its not free i have checked with the amazon they told its not free anymore wall mount is not with the tv we have to purchase it from the amazon technical guy and cost is around better to purchase it separately there is aspects to start tv when unplugged and re plug it its taking around sec to completely start the tv plugged and switch off from remote and switch on from the remote again its taking around secconclusion wont recommend to purchase now might be after resolving it by an software update might be take some month i guess after months of usage tv is getting stuck sometimes need to unplug and replug to start working again sometimes composite mode is not working only shows blue background for sec and comes back to home page hi team i bought this tv around months back and getting wifi issue and remote control problem from day and open a case with support team its been a month till now no resolution chasing care from oneplus care app twitter whatsapp mail support but no resolution i don t know when can i get resolution after months my warranty period will be over i dnt have hopes please think before you buy this is my personal experience iam not enforcing anyone this is after days i opened a ticket months back but till now there is no resolution customer care guys just closing the ticket and asking feedback there main focus is on feedback not on resolution other side i escalated to amazon still there is no resolution i don t know when i can get resolution i bought this tv from amazon after months one fine day i couldn t turn on the tv since i have paid for extra warranty i contacted amazon for technical support i scheduled the appointment times every time the technician didn t turn up and they reschedule it i was contacting oneplus as well nobody visited or tried to resolve the issue and keep on sending automated replies now it s been nearly months and still its not resolved i have bought this tv in august i have started facing lag glitches screen freeze since feb since then it s been calls to customer care service schedules and on hold status you will not get any help from amazon or qdigi one plus partner it s a bad launch i can t describe the months of harassment by amazon and one plus to finally telling me that my warranty is over now in august and no further help can be done without actually resolving anything first i received this product with a different stand and they send a replacement for this all this process took around month finally i got a working product after using it for months we were watching the tv suddenly it stopped working i raised a complaint immediately i waited for few days and started calling customer care every day the phone will be attending by different executives they will tell theirs on stories it will be assigned to technician or the call with escalated to you will get a call back so and so after a month and half the complaint got assigned to a technician and without visiting the site they told they have ordered for parts during all this time we were using our old tv good that we haven t sold at last they came the home with a tv and exchanged some parts with our tv the tv is working but one issue the tv display is coming opposite side if we rotate the tv only we will be able to see now they told me there are no settings in the remote to change the direction they will come with software to resolve this issue again the service person came and tried to fix it but still it s not resolved now they want to take the tv to service place and we have to get it from there not sure how much time it will take this is my experience with the oneplus tv i would suggest don t go for this product if you still want to buy then arrange an alternative and be ready i think that i should have bought mi x instead of this but the inch of mi x was not available on amazon and i don t like to buy from flipkart this oneplus tv has lot of lag issues since it has only gb of ram the optimization is poor the sound is not good at all for a room it is okay but after volume don t know if volume even increases instead the effect increases which compromises the quality of sound i recommend buying a soundbar does not power on by single click from remote some issue with that doesn t have new features like multicast only buy it if you re a oneplus fan otherwise go for mi x instead that provides k and better optimized performance low quality product bought in first sale sound quality is so poor returned after few days honest review let me write one by one review after weeks first of all i have pre booked oneplus y and availed the acko s years extended warranty and also amazon echo dot along with this tvwhich is worth to buy at k those who have missed echo dot i feel very sorry for them also alexa worked me as a smart connector between tv and my sony home theatre system without any digital cables or converters saved my money there too picture quality is pretty good and i led display viewing angle should be straight and if it s more than degree picture clarity will reduce and colours starts fading make sure you are straight infront of tv view sound quality is ok kind of quality at this price as i am depending more on home theatre speakers thus it s good for me value for money yes definitely you can choose at this budget unless like other brands of this range and it s chromecasting is built in can avail from ios platform too as i am using it includes all the modern smart tv features like netflix amazon youtube and google assistants in one single button but some time lag can be experienced while changing the input sources even google assistance is bit slow to catch up when compared to alexa overall i can give thanks team oneplus and amazon in pros contrast ratio is amazing black level is amazing viewing angles are fine awesome color accuracy latest android version cons poor quality speakers little bit lag probably the os as for speakers why would you use inbuilt speakers what matters most is contrast ratio color range viewing angles and clarity bit over pricingamazon installation installation has not completed waited for days then done with local technician amazon service is getting poorer the media could not be loaded google assistant is not working properly smartest smart tv from oneplus in this price range no other tv s has such picture quality and features its totally premium product just one thing pls buy soundbar or any sound system with this this tv has dolby digital dolby digital plus surround sound which are awesome functions indeed but u can feel these features only if u have external sound system else the speakers of w each are very low in volume a good movie with sound effects cant be enjoyed at all else this tv is highly recommended all the features works perfectly as the company says in ads value for money indeed one update after using the tv for month never faced problems like auto restart lags etc but yes if u install loads of apps then u should wait few seconds when u start the tv else u will see lil lags but after few seconds it will run smoothly tv works fine features are also impressive but the rigidity of the tv is questionable installation service by one plus was very poor the installation was scheduled between pm and they reached around pm and left around pm the fixed wall mount used was in rusted condition and they drilled total holes on the tv mounting board for screw and the wooden board got damaged the tv was tilted to one side after installation and then they had to use small paper pieces to level the tv for the fixed tv mount the charge was rs even though the charge written in amazon is rs for a tv by comparing with my friend mi tv oneplus is very bad the picture quality and sound quality is very poor comparing with his tv the remote control and voice recognition is perfect but the clarity of display is very bad according to mi tv till the reviewing date there is no inbuilt apps for screen casting etc we should seperatly want to download airscreen app from play store for installing other apps this tv not have file manager to download apk from usb we should also want to download that from play store i am damn sure that my friends mi tv is better than oneplus tv my rating to this tv is not worth this tv for better go for mi tv or other brands like tcl realme etc i think that oneplus will overall these products but in case of tv till i am putting the review mi tv is good by comparing with my friends tv the media could not be loaded this review is in usage of months worst product from oneplus i just don t even understand why they had to come into tv my personal opinion always go with sony or lg it is the best nd time issue with the display first issue arrived after months i bought the tv same as you see in the picture this image is second time issue but it was working for mins and it started to fade away i usually don t use the tv much so i didn t care about it for months then it started to fade forever so had to book a service nonsense in this pandemic it took months to fix fine atleast some picture to see in the second lockdown after the service and it didn t like to work after month after the st service same kind of issue this image is reference after st service done to display changing the whole display i personally recommend sony of lg they are best in tvs ofcourse they are high priced for what reason you guys might think this is the reason these guys i just don t understand why did i even step foot in these kinds of company s for a different product they are utter waste of time and money i have used the tv only for months that s it and i m in second services with one year bullshit what others think about this tv or the brand shame to say i m oneplus user for years now cheap quality displays they use so is the lowest price amazing product got it for k a ton of features added pixel quality is ok you can easily notice it with different colours using android enabled smart tv hence have same emotions like the way android works or probably the function processing capability of the tv is not at par tv remote sensor works only in you are in range of metres irrespective of inserting battery cells i feel my tata sky remote sensor was out of the world since it use to capture signals from any corner of the room where my old tv was installed piece of advise if you money to spend go for another brand or device altogether and you limited on budget i would recommend you to with this tv amazing picture and sound quality superb awesome tv must buy it go for it thnsk oneplus i have bought version of this series tv there was network connection issue while i troubleshoot found that date and time was set as sep every time we switch on the tv because of this internet connection through our wifi router is not connected even though other devices get connected with same wifi network when i do the warranty claim after three or four visits either oneplus or authorized service personal amazon itself cannot find the solution so every time we switch on tv we need to set date and time for proper internet connectivity otherwise it will work like a normal led tv only not smart tv you cannot use any app installed or you cannot install any new apps think before buying this tv as this involves big risk i am writing this review after using the tv for last one month no response for replacement from either side best product at this price the best in this price segment the media could not be loaded awesome quality product everything is perfect you can go for it very bad service please go with sony or samsung one plus service is very bad if your tv is under warranty you have to pay for the any problem i bought this before month ago but now the bubbling issue is appearing on the screen i called customer care they accepted that it s under warranty but after days they asked me for k waiting for the installation from starting day of purchase i m getting issue with tv but nothing happened neither did solve with amazon customer care nor with onplus customer care still i am helpess worst tv ever scene from starting day issue is coming displayed showing black and white usb does not supporting any pendrive any app if opening it s taking second to open so much of lagging issue from starting day the bit it not look it s supporting at all gb of ram is still low i guess amazon told again happened they will replaced the tv but after days policy they assured that after third technical support my policy was going they said don t worry you will get replacement if this happened again now all issue i am facing neither amazon can t do or not one plus service is doing amazon worst ever mr jeff bezos amit agarwal i am quite happy with the product weightless tv great job by one plus the media could not be loaded it s hardly one month and the tv is unusable volume keeps increasing and screen flickers to the bottom cannot control the tv through remote reached out to customer care and the response very slow update sep customer care replaced the remote and it did not solve the issue more than a month that i raised a complaint and the problem still exists pathetic support amazon just keeps escalating the issue without resolution awesome tv avoid buying this tv it s seems cheap but so is the performance i bought this tv one week back and in this one week i have faced the following problems on tv has hung frozen four times audio was on but video was completely blanked out once lag when bluetooth headphone is connected and the audio breaks replacement cannot be done until service centre guy checks it service centre person never turns up despite multiple follow ups raised the issue with amazon on th and still waiting for some service centre person to pick my call and attend to the problemdissapointing the media could not be loaded very good tv excellent picture quality perfect for a common man s middle class family perfect as per expectations never thought i will have to write a negative feedback for oneplus products we insisted our parents to buy this tv and we are regretting it the tv constantly hangs and everytime we ask for a return or for replacement of the product a technician is been appointed to check the tv i really don t know how to sync the timing of technician and the time when tv hangs to be at the same time really disappointed by the product and also by amazon because i still don t have any clarity whether or not there is going to be replacement or refund or not requesting amazon to kindly provide the relevant information and solve the grevieneces of geneiue customers note i have called amazon customer service for atleast timesawaiting a positive response from amazon i installation not done properly i have registered my complaintsound is not great buy vu cinema tv for good soundpicture quality is goodui is goodremote is good clutter free simple cute after using for one month now there is display issues i am really not happy with oneplus purchase lags a lot sony home theatre connected to the tv worked fine for the first month but post some software update started to face too many issues home theatre not getting recognised remote issue the one plus customer service is very bad they take weeks to respond they are yet to come and check what the issue is bought the tv on the first day it was launched but regrett now very upsetting experience worth the money and the quality is splendid awesome the remote stopped working it isnt damaged by any means i don t know now how to use the tv as nothing can work without remote so useless product as expected from china there is a lot of lag while operating the tv with remote to switch on the tv i need to try atleast times and if it still does not work i need to manually switch on the tv by pressing the button behind tv i really like the one plus brand but tv definitely is not up to the mark can t handle the lag sometimes it s very frustrating after paying so much money and can t do anything when the remote does not work i m sure i definitely can use connect feature on my one plus mobile phone as remote but what s the tv remote for when it does not do what it is supposed to do giving review after month of usage one of the worst tv s i have ever seen avg display avg sound doesn t switch on as soon as i power on from the remote need to press at least times to switch on tv there s a lot of lag for volume buttons sometimes tv itself goes to home page from live tv and doesn t go back to live tv need to switch off tv and switch it on again after month of usage tv hanged up a few times the tv even doesn t connect to oneplus connect app need to find tv on mobileapp for so much time sometimes even after many trails i can t connect to my tv even opening and closing apps is very laaagggggyyyyy the media could not be loaded very nice i bought this tv based on my experience with one plus phone contrary to the quality of the phones the tv quailty has proven to be nightmare for me on top of that their service is poor the option to register complaint through amazon gives no result st the display was not proper after complaining they took two months to change the display the new display lasted only days and now its completely black screen with few colored lines its been days i have raised complaint to both amazon and one plus directly but all in vain i will not recommended this tv to anyone i have two more tvs at my home both samsung never faced any such issue samsung has the same price and same features i wish i can replace it for samsung and now its the third time that the tv is down rd time in warranty period just today the installation guy came and install the tv perfectly st glanacethis is almost an bezel less tv i cannot expect much in this price but the design is quite stylishsecondly it took some time for start at first timebut then after it is smooth nd galanceafter completed all the setups on tv for its specs gb ram it is super smooth no doubt there is an delay of to seconds but that ok as tv used frequently then that delays also minimises rd glanacethe sound is grt for this price point it s not that you purchase a tv under k and ten compared it with k tv that s unfair but the tv comes with dolby atoms and dolby atmos both features for sound th finalelastly google assistant works pretty well with this tv too it response time is in milliseconds impressed with the product quality and design performance is also decent video quality is quiet good audio not up to the expectations terrible installation service technician never contacted even after days from the delivery date contacted amazon many times had to reschedule times canceled the service at last like the title of my review said i am going to only list down the factual pros and cons after a day of using the tv elaborately and let you decide for yourself pros great picture quality especially if content is in hd the smart tv features that allows you to pair it with your phone laptop bluetooth speakers bluetooth headphones etc are super handy the screen size of is just perfect for your room unless it is ultra spaciouscons the sound w is loud enough but the quality is really poor and one dimensional so you will surely need an external sound system or sowaker the finishing of the product is not the best one can tell how oneplus managed to price this at k when you pay attention to how they ve cut corners on the quality the oneplus logo on the front is titled first time i ve ever seen this on a product from a reputed brand there s a considerable gap between the display and top corner bezels and the plastic finishing isn t even there s a lag when you re operating the tv switching between apps browsing content and giving google assistant voice commands of the time hoping oneplus fixes it with future software updates but so far there s no official word on thatthose are my pros and cons in a nutshell now the decision is yours hello please do not buy tv from online because i bought one plus tv on june th within months display went off after that i am trying for warranty claim but it s been days still no one from amazon responding properly i don t know when issue will be resolved so better go to local vendor and buy electronic items atleast we can ask that guy if any problem occurs i like vry much i bought this tv in pre booking the tv quality is adequate there is nothing good about it after months my tv face an issue where hdmi ports were non functional it has been days yet i complained both amazon and oneplus for the warranty but both are unable to repair it because of scarcity of parts oneplus is not the same brand it used to be the products are pathetic and sub standard nice tv as far as display and sound is concerned the tv is a good buy but the tv lags very much the processor isn t that powerful i don t know how at the launch time the demos work so fine navigating between sources apps volume control is very laggy switching tv on is very tricky sometimes it takes button clicks to turn on tv this issue is same with mi tvs as well the output of video quality is really good but the tv lags very oftenly major manufacturing problem in all y series inch television is with hdmi port the screen keeps flickering or goes blank for seconds if connected to hdmi tried with different devices in hdmi port to confirm the issue i got the tv replaced but the same error again persists even with the replacement tv hence it s confirmed that there is some manufacturing deffect with this model of television great product value for money go for it reviewing after using the product for a month picture quality is awesome it will beat many other competitors in this price range but not that great as boasted in the launch event sound quality is average but you have to make some changes in the settings to get a good sound output but compared to motorola and realme tv in this price range it ll lose in this tv to get a good sound output you have to max the volume software is the point where i got disappointed from one plus i expected many things because it s a tv from oneplus the tv lags a little bit control from the tv remote takes seconds for the tv to operate i hope one plus gives a good proper update to clear this problem ram is gb and the storage is gb out of which the available is gb motorola has gb of free space so a little disappointment but it s a tv after all not a smartphone input ports works fine and u won t get a mm port opening an app takes some time which is a little irritating as said about the oneplus connect app it s not that hype what you saw during the launch event one annoying thing is you have to open a oneplus connect app from the tv and then you can use it from your smartphone typing option is not available sometimes the tv doesn t open youtube have to restart the tv and then open youtube if oneplus is seeing this review i expect you to solve the software issue regarding the lag which annoys a lotone more thing i couldn t connect alexa to this tv also i couldn t connect google remote overall it s a good budget tv but it s not that buttery smooth if the software issue is solved then this tv will be a great budget tv i hope my review helps you amazing the media could not be loaded hd best quality product at a cheap price amazing as it should be nice tv under k got a faulty remote straight out of the box with neither oneplus nor amazon taking responsibility and both asking me to approach the other as a manufacturer oneplus should ideally honour warranty replacements especially when the product is less than hours old and faulty right out if you re buying this be warned that oneplus support is super apathetic and you ll probably be left fending for yourself tv is fine ish as a product nothing exceptional it s rife with software bugs and lags can t even download apps because they all get stuck on pending go for an amazon firetv a non smart tv with a fire stick an apple tv or just assemble one yourself you ll have a better experience than with this garbage product and company this has been one hell of a let down it isnt a bad tv but something about it that leaves me disappointed i have had many tvs sony lg mi vu they have all add something to vow this one comes out as very ordinary but if you are burying it its not the tv that will bother you its the service its been weeks since i raised a complaint they have done nothing about it tweeting calling mailing nothing has worked so my advise look for someone who respects your business excellent the tv i bought is not worth its too damn slow it starts and switches off on own installation was not proper may be even after resetting everything the tv works on its own n is very damn slow voice commands does not work review after a week pros less bezel not bezel less screen quality is okay for the price range cons muffled audio no bass not even b of bass software glitches remote response time is slow color reproduction not accurate no ir for remote cheap material a mediocre at best product from oneplus overall best tv i got this tv on august and installation was done on august after using for day i noticed some problem in the display there were some black and white spots on the screen when the screen comes to white colour in my opinion this tv is worst ever sound quality is also poor and picture quality is ok overall my experience is not good and i will not recommend to buy this oneplus tv very nice first of all the tv is very slow and takes minutes to switch on and respond to the remote once i press the google button to use voice search the tv just becomes so stuck and stays like that for minutes it also randomly get switched off while watching because of these complaints i raised a service request and it has been a month and no action action taken yet now the tv is failing to get connected to wifi as well this is by far the worst purchase from amazon i am a regular amazon customer and never expected to get cheated like this so please don t buy this tv and get into trouble like me bought this tv in sept in the first week only it started saying connected but no internet at first i thought some network issues but later figured out all other devices were working fine only this tv has the problem that time i placed for a service request also that guy came and reset the whole tv and it became alright i thought some small glitch after that a few days later it again happend and i reset and added all the apps again this kept on happening till date and abt days the service incharge came an checked as soon as he saw he said its a problem with the board and he will raise a request for replacement for the board in working days and slipped away i waited and after a few days called him n he is washing his hands away saying he cannot do much abt it and will have to check with amazon the great amazon has escaleted the issue times n till date nothing has happend amazonindia ur cheats today i m trying to call and my call is only getting sent from pillar to post people oneplus the great chinese and great amazon are trying to fool people dont trust this tv or any other devices they only now how to cheat people and take people for a ride never ever will buy anything from amazon worst customer care shut shop and go the media could not be loaded i am writing this review after days of usei was excited for the one plus tv as i have oneplus devices in my home and i am extremely satisfied with all of then but as soon as the tv got installed i noticed that the app icons in the onelus ui were blur i could see the pixels distorted i asked the the installation guy if it was some settings issue he tried to fix it and said that it is like that onlyi compared it with my other fhd tv mi a pro and there was a major difference after days the os started lagging very much startup takes minimum sec the voice recognition is very bad the chromecast is worse it lags as hell that you can t even understand a single word chromecast keep failing when tried to connect with laptop the oneplus connect app has a sec delay the picture quality is that bad you can see the screen distorting in wallpapers even after so many defects both amazon and oneplus has declined my refund saying that it is a quality issue and no refund would be provided for the same i have purchased this tv in august and after just one month of purchasing its display suddenly stopped working when i made complaint in amazon because product is in warranty period so zero services provided from amazon s side as well as one plus now its been more than months and none of the technician came at my place for this thing when i escalated issues even on twitter as well amazon said contact the one plus directly we can not help so till now nothing is done in this case and after august they will say product is not in warranty period so guys i now i will not buy any of the one plus product and recommend the same to you as well this is my story which i thought to share with you if in case you are planning to buy any of the one plus product i am using this tv now since last days i find it very good pictire quality is excellent as well as the sound quality you just need to make the settings right there are various options in settings very elegant look may be smallest size in inch segment there are few negative review about it s panel quality on youtube which is deliberately made by one reviewer it seems all other experts have appraised this product consthakes few seconds to load as inch tv mostly comes with gb ram but this is okone major concern is screen mirroring from mobile which is really slow app cast has no issue overall it s a very good product worrest product and worrest service don t buy it is a one plus tv but local quality and not manufacturer one plus manufacturer in hyderabad local company and assembled and i bought july and worked days after apps not installed and not updated after tv screen black so i am complaint to amazon they till resolved my issue till date and there is no one plus customer care service centers and very difficult contact one plus customer care and they not respond one plus tv service done by amazon service persons only tgis is not brand so don t buy waste of money and time take brand tv and good service available very bad experience in this tv i have faced amazon people also very irregular service with in two months i have two major issues in tv ine is mother board and tv screen tq please check every one mafacture details in tv box shocked tq it s good and worth too the media could not be loaded very worst company and very bad customer support i have purchased this one plus y tv on july and tv display has gone on aug i have complained and talk to many times to amazon and one plus care they only send technicians for visit i m writing this review after days from complaint date and still they are saying that due to unavailable of parts i am not able to repair your tv they are just making fool to indian user pls don t buy and don t suggest to any one the product came faulty out of the box within two months of purchase there were visible lines and blacked out picture when connected to a set top box so finally one day the product decided to quit with no picture but just rgb lines on display see for the details in shared pic now coming to the service part it s been almost months since i am trying to get it serviced or repaired by amazon product support agency well it is a new year now still no luck the customer care executives are a bunch of fools with no remors of your problem their constant jab is wait for hrs problem will be resolved they provide you with all sorts of misinformation regarding their product support one told me it will be fulfilled by oneplus honestly oneplus don t give a flying duck about customer or later in product support with multiple calls and false promises i called back amazon cs this is when i came to know the product and service will be done by amazon anyway after multiple calls and escalations till date no one visited an engineer was scheduled to visit while he didn t and contacted me via call and asked me to click picture of the problem and send me via whatsapp after looking upon it he told me it s a manufacturing defect and will be replaced at the earliest well later received a mail from amazon stating support has been cancelled so the moral of the story is the struggle is real purchase one plus at your own risk don t trust amazon for any service related query very good picture quality enjoying watching movies sound quality require some improvement easy to connect with app very good installation service lots of one start in review are due to not getting alexa offer and faulty products and installation service regarding alexa they mentioned it s free or on less price but as there routine offer it s not kept easily available u have to check and add offer in u r cart which is not expected from amazon it heart s if you buy product and not got offered alexa so my sincere request to amazon if u are willing to give any offer keep it easy and don t hide it else didn t give what we are getting in this price one tv we are happy thanks worst tv experience that i have ever had in my life with this tv worst customer service experience and service amazon kept the promise of contacting the manufacturer which was to harsh for a month old tv tv had bad screen issue remote issue waiting for the drama to get over from the one plus side screen flickering is the most common problem half of the times tv doesn t start with a single button press by the remote booting takes at least seconds screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time system lag is the maximum in this class of tv s most of the apps doesn t work which is downloaded from playstore youtube apps crashes many times airtel extreme doesn t work picture quality doesn t beyond p even if play the k video overall the bad experience which is never expected from the brand like oneplus the media could not be loaded don t buy oneplus tv i bought oneplus y series in tv with in one and half month tv screen problem i search technician in chennai vellore and kanchipuramnot available in district then i realised total tamilnadu technician not availablelocal service man told that you complaint register to customer care then he will guide you like that my first complaint registered sep th still to times following for recovery of complaintbut more than month completed still my tv problem not solvedso don t buy oneplus tv the media could not be loaded i bought oneplus y series smart tv on sep and during the initial usage i felt like this was the best grab for the price because oneplus gives its superior build quality and smart features and everything seems to be fine for first months literally everything was good but after two months of usage the tv suddenly started showing display issues such as change in colour flickering etc and this issue disappears when the tv is restarted again this issue started appearing on random basis and goes when restarted so when this happened multiple times i myself recorded a video and pictures of the same and contacted amazon for the service believe me this is where it all started to become worser the technician visited my home and confirmed it that the tv is having manufacturing defect as it doesn t have any physical damage from then it almost took months of continued followup with amazon customer care to solve my issue the issue was escalated multiple time and still was not resolved i talked with superior associate still they also couldn t solve my issue at last after multiple complaints and escalation on priority basis and to management level they had to accept the return as an exception oneplus brand didn t meet the expectations in its tv good i thought that oneplus name might have a good quality product for tv like mobiles but they failed after the purchase of tv with in a month the remote stopped working and when raised a issue with oneplus customer care they sent a service person and he confirmed me that the remote is faulty and will be replaced with a new one but after days of complaint registered still they haven t provided a remote all they do is close the ticket after few days and asked to open a new one for the same complaint they say that they don t have a spare remote and this is the response from one plus customer care and they don t know when they might have it days without remote that too on the early days after the tv lauch they are not good with service all they are good with one time sales worst support in the industry brand new one plus tvs are having issues with bluetooth connectivity i have observed this issue after the return window is over else could have returned it one plus being such a reputed company this is not great on their part looks like they are now compromising on the quality to bring the prices down to compete with the like of other chinese players bad experience i would recommend to go for established brands such as lg samsung panasonic etc tv hangs randomly have to switch it completely off at least once a day and switch on again the apps malfunction netflix exits on its own sometimes youtube opens when we hit the netflix button on the remote remote connectivity is also not fool proof sometimes it gets stuck while fast forwarding to connect to different bluetooth device have to disconnect from the current one as there is no option to scan when connected to a device already the tv has most features but they will malfunction sometimesvoice recognition doesn t work this tv takes so much time to get start since we bought this it is having an issue with start up and sudden switch off issue but we did not get the replacement even the amazon is not helping in this and says we don t have policy for the return of the product why it should not be returnable on a day one good i just have a single suggestion don t go for it i ignored the reviews while purchasing the product stating there are lot of glitch in the tv software i thought those glitches would go after the update but it didn t happen the tv has lot of problems it started from day problems with product youtube and other apps crashes all of the sudden volume key most of the times doesn t work tv doesn t respond to the remote almost all the time chromecast doesn t work pros picture quality is average sound quality is good tv build up quality is good plz dont purchase this specific product with amazone because of customer service center not provide you priority service because of you are amazons customer not oneplus brand s so i m suggesting purchase threw brand so thet will give you proper service after delivery of my tv i m getting my installation after days and now i want to claim warranty because of product issue with internet connectivity so now one plus customer care executive not replying me properly and amazon customer service dont do anything because of warranty given by one plus not amazone pathetic tv it does not connect to the sony music system the guy who came was just in a hurry to fix it and run did not clearly explain things and did not give solution to connect the home theatre despite asking him day it is not detecting set top box even though the hdmi is plugged in properly having a tough time with the tv the biggest mistake in my life was to go for this tv i will give zero stars for this product suggestion spend a little more and get a better established television brand the media could not be loaded this tv is not great or not worst i liked the picture quality in this range and bezel less view is awesome attached picture however not having aux support is minus sound quality of tv is poor poor and loud sound doesn t help and recently i ve found a dead pixel on the screen of which i ve attached the picture technician came and checked it received an update saying waiting for warranty part will update how everything went once anything is done updating on received replacement part received part was replaced to tv with original one executive messed it up and tv is not showing true colors now to say it is showing negative like colors looking trust on amazon day by day chatted with agent called seizel who is stubborn and not at all listening rescheduled a service appointment will see what will happen and update here will not recommend this product strongly overall so so experience like the tv overall good picture quality and software interface i would recommend it however i feel the following could have been done differently the sound quality isn t all that impressive the speakers aren t loud enough i m using additional speakers with my tv the processor used is quite slow i see apps hanging at times which forces me to reboot the tv the setup process wasn t very smooth when i first started the tv i couldn t install or update apps i had to reset the tv to get the play store working i can t find a way to boot the tv to the home screen it directly boots to the live tv interface i don t have cable or set top box so this doesn t make sense to me if there is a way i haven t been able to find out how yet after searching a lot online the base of the tv doesn t feel stable one has to take a lot of care if one wants to move the tv it s very inconvenient that the ports in the center especially because of point if your tv is on the table this makes it hard to access the ports we have to move the tv to access the ports and makes it difficult the ports should have been placed on the side since usb is the port i ll be using the most i got around the problem by purchasing a usb cable that i can access without moving the tv i went for the in tv instead of the in one just because i don t have place to keep the larger in tv if you have place for the in tv and if it fits into your budget i would recommend going for that one it would have been nice if oneplus offered a in tv with all the in features for a slightly higher price than the current in tv good tv superb picture quality craaaaazy user interface within a month of purchase tv started hanging need to press remote times to get it started loggged a complaint on april and upto today issue is not resolved and one plus customer care is saying we can not tell you when it will get repaired first and last oneplus product worst experience review update on i have contacted customer care several times and still they haven t responded amazon customer care just says that they follow up the matter but still i havnt received any updates regarding they matter they just don t value people s money these people just wanna sell the product n don t wanna know elwhat happens after salei have one plus mobile so i thought that tv will be having the same quality the tv is awesome but the service from oneplus amazon is worst display n all is good but tv don t have any built in quality the main board of the tv was damaged within one month of use and till now these amazon oneplus people havnt done anything to get it replaced it s your money so please don t invest in these items were they don t even bother to give a service worst experience i am facing dont go for appliances in amazon installation process will not done by actual slot they will change as per their convenient my tv delivered on may and installation slot booked on may but no one contacted me for installation while call back to customer care they simply saying wait for weeks and weeks if we wait for installation for weeks what is the use of buying these products go for flipkart they are doing same day installation too lose full hope on amazon no one responding properly please dont buy any appliances in amazon if u buy u will face same problem which i am facing i had worst ever than worst experience with oneplus tv very low quality build material cheaper hanging restarting problem when you switching between app google assistant not working since i update the android version sound quality is the biggest setback it sounds like a rd rate speaker and sound isn t balanced there is no clarity in the sound you won t be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen frame of tv isn t durable it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute remote is very slow it takes time and you have to proper focus infront of tv bad policy of amazon technician from oneplus visit to solve but failed technician from amazon come two time for inspection failed to solve they are not able to do anythingso i will not suggest to purchase oneplus tv a lot of problems writing this review after using the tv over than a month the picture quality is doubtlessly good sound is average not good for a big room there are problems with remote control for eg sometimes when the volume button is pressed on tv remote the set top box is responding with recall command chromecast does slow response sometimes the tv automatically goes to home page a software updating is inevitable for addressing this problems design bug currently version had been installed in my device everytime restart power on reset takes the time to jan pm because of this google products aren t working unless i change the time settings manually to current date and time so i strongly recommend to take opinion from other users too am planning to raise service request on this issue to amazon the display is hdready n worst color saturation n brightness is killing after watching for min for days i ruined my eyes and when contacted amazon they say follow up n complain to one plus in return one plus rngennier resettled while tv which ruined the display more n it is so bright that u see white patches n if reduce the background light n brightness color s gets dark one plus not ready to listen or change the tv i think i have done blunder by purchasing only in the name of one plus be informed pl don t blindly buy see it to believ it i have contacted amazon multiple times and every time i get the same answer there is no stock for replacement i am clueless about what should be my next step extremely bad after sales services worst better to get a tv from local store than such products back in july oneplus launched its budget tvs line up i prebooked the tv on the launch day itself after around two weeks the tv went on flash sale for the first time i received the tv after a week i got the tv for around rs i prebooked the device for rs which gave me two years extended warranty and rs amazon cashback also i got amazon echo dot for free and a tv which i returned and got a refund for the same it was a great deal and so i decided to go for the oneplus tv with an excellent price tag it comes with some exciting features like oneplus connect dolby audio enhancement oxygen play chromecast google assistant built in and compatible with amazon alexa i was very much excited to unbox and try the oneplus tv it also comes with android unboxing the tv and attaching the table mount was an easy process also setting up the device was very easy initial impressions when i first started the device it was lagging a lot however there was already a software update available when i just started the device i quickly updated the device and the tv was still not working smooth enough i think going gb ram is not enough the picture quality is impressive and the sound quality isn t good at default settings after tweaking the sound it sounded terrific regarding connectivity it was very smooth the bezel less design was the most attractive part of the tv design the design is the most decisive point of the tv it comes with a bezel less display an screen to body ratio and an enhanced viewing experience it is slim from the back of the tv also the ports are accessible quite easily the table mount is also of decent quality and there is a led indicator in the bottom right corner of the tv overall i loved the design and form factor of the tv rating display the display comes with a bunch of fancy features it comes with a p resolution and has dci p provides excellent colour reproduction it uses gamma engine for picture enhancement and has features like anti aliasing noise reduction dynamic contrast and colour space mapping it also comes with various display tweaks such as sports mode movie mode and many others but i just tweaked them to get the best out of the tv the default settings aren t as good as expected after tweaking the colours and overall picture quality is soothing although i think the fps doesn t look smooth enough it seems like fps to sum up the display is excellent at this price point although you need to tweak the settings to get the best out of the display rating sound it comes with a w speaker output and also supports dolby audio enhancement the default sound settings aren t sounding that great after tweaking the audio settings it works at its best it is loud enough and no complaints apart from default settings rating connectivity we get all the required connectivity options it comes with ghz wi fi bluetooth ethernet rf connection input hdmi input av input digital audio output and usb ports and the most legendary feature is the oneplus connect we can control the tv entirely using a phone take screenshots of the tv and save and share it you can also control the tv actions such as volume switch input open apps and turn off tv using amazon echo dot but there is an issue with the remote tv won t power on off on the first attempt it also doesn t have a dedicated input switch button rating pros awesome colour accuracy dci p and beautiful display quality great sound quality with features like dolby audio enhancement dialogue enhancer dolby surround etc oneplus connect app features like taking tv screenshots controlling tv etc aggressive price point amazon echo dot integration and google assistant built in bezel less display enhances the viewing experience cons it lags a lot at times and especially after turning on the tv from sleep mode tv won t power on the first attempt of the times default audio and display settings aren t the best gb ram isn t enough for the tv no wall mount inside the box no input switch button on the remote really loved the optv y serieshave some lil probs bt thts finee hope oneplus will fix this in next update everything works fine so farlittle lag bt it s okay it happens in every android tvoneplus tv is handy with oneplus mobile phones but doesn t support screen cast with mi phonesaudio n video quality is top notch need to change in settings overall best for this price range writing this review after a month of use pros compare to other tv in this price range sound quality is good smooth installation after paying installation charges around k plus including wall mount picture quality is goodcons voice recognition is annoying bluetooth paring is messy some time u need to unpair and pair again in case of u r connecting a sound at totally disappointed with the reliability of the one tv experience decided to go for this product in spite of a few nasty reviews online because of the trust in the brand issues noticed from day tv switches off on its own which was experienced times in the first week tv gets stuck while switching on then a restart is required by turning off the power lag noticed occasionally while playing browsing i was fortunate enough to experience the issues in the earlier days itself so that i could ask for a return keeping the issues aside the look and feel of tv is just amazing screen and sound clarity are impressive really good features worst delivery myself being a prime member got the product after days followed up for days complained multiple time abt product not delivered multiple calls uffff could see finger prints on the tv screen just when opened from box worst thing which i am scared is could see blur screen n lines while setting up the tv itself bluetooth remote pairing takes very long time screen is very very fragile sound quality is very poor picture quality is good awsome experience installation quick clean and fine accuracy demo amazing executive was so calm to explain each feature in detail sometimes multiple times to multiple family members picture quality star all streaming apps runs on hd content cable channels are sd though we can t see major difference in video quality sound real dolby we generally use only volume in my x size drawing room set top box existing airtel dth sd set top box gives good video quality so we don t feel to upgrade to hd set top box streaming performance superb my kid watches youtube of the time in a day fhd video streaming is superb in youtube premium with my you broadband mbps wifi network bluetooth sometimes my kid uses bluetooth handsfree while watching tv especially in afternoon when everyone in home are sleeping except him sound quality even in bluetooth is awsome without any relay i had bought mi one plus both tv on same day for homes from amazon i must say one plus brand amazon commerce platform is best to choose purchased it on th july seems to be good so far this tv got screwed up within one years time when i lodged a complaint within warranty period no one came to repair every week they keep saying next week next week the week never comes it has been two months never buy anything from one plus ever neither is amazon helping us out the media could not be loaded considering price it s a great value for money picture quality and sound is just perfect best thing is sophisticated remote with only required key options it s been days we ve used this tv and haven t faced and lag ussues or any other issues so far quite happy with the product oneplus tv panel had developed horizontal lines since last months and i had been chasing the company for service through various modes including chats but nothing worked out today booked service through amazon to see how they respond now but yes service is extremely pathetic months have passed and i m losing this warranty benefit no one from oneplus responds on the same i did a big mistake of my decision to purchase oneplus tv writing the review after years of usage good the display looks good for this price range really good if you are using this as a secondary display for your laptop sound quality is promising picture color quality is comparatively goodbad lags when you use any of the inbuilt apps specially prime disney hotstar youtube etc sometime it automatically switch from hdmi mode to home screen freeze during the normal operation turning on with the remote is a biggest challenge and frustrating never found the easy way to do it so started using the manual power button switch off the tv if not in use or else it will turn on automatically and spoil your sleep i have bought one plus tv as i was very much happy with one plus brand after using the one plus phone i was badly disappointed with the product thanks to amazon as they took the unit return back and refunded the money i want to tell separately about the bad experiences picture quality it was sometime too bright and sometimes too dull screen was blue green sometimes as you see in the attached image hdmi port was faulty sound quality quality of the sound was like cheap speakers used in the tv unit overall comment not up to the expectations not recommended to purchase after days of usage i see the product works too slow the picture quality is fine after switching on the tv we can expect the response only after minutes that in my opinion a waste to buy normal smart or android tv work faster than oneplus sound is satisfactory google voice search doesn t work couldn t add oneplus account to the tv oneplus connect using oneplus mobile as remote looks like a joke or silly app to use because that doesn t work and connect well with oneplus mobile do not waste time waiting for the sale i am writing this review after using this tv for months and i received two updates in months tv picture quality is amazing you get the best viewing experience but sound and it s android is pathetic from starting i see lags in this tv and i thought it get resolved after updates but it s not resolved yet syetem interface is really slow if you re planning to buy this tv go for upper one plus tv not this one picture quality amazingremote control very soft speedy oprationsound quality quite dispointed but not bad for inches tv overall oneplus is best as other comparative i am used oneplus mobile from last years only amezon service was very bad not customer supportive the media could not be loaded this is after week of usage watch attached video after speaking to amazon customer care they have assigned some amazon service agent the agent said he will fix the issue but even after months there is no resolution to my issue never expected such a worst service from amazon purchase even after reaching to cc they said they will sendsome technician but till now after days no one reached i request who ever see this review never ever purchase from amazon site products i ll give rating tv screen is defective after using months and amazon is not providing warrenty claim for the tv upon raising service request amazon mark it completed without any technician i suggest not to buy this product from amazon because you will not get any warrenty claim if product is defective one year warranty claim is fake amazon is not providing any warrenty claim don t buy from amazon tv is absolutely value proposition all required features are in the tv if you have a one plus phone then its a quick sync for first time installation dislike does not come with a wall mount stand the hd cable requirement is a cable these offset you by an additional amount depending on what you add on also you need to proactively call the installation guys as they were not aware of my installation job guys please don t buy oneplus tv and it s not a good product we bought a new tv months old and now it s not working now i have called the support and written back and forth emails but no support it s a worst support which i have never seen till today go for the mi or samsung user interface is good sound quality is poor have to use external speakers for clear sound better options are available in this price range edit after using the tv for months i have downgraded my rating form two to one star bluetooth connectivity is very poor you get delayed response the screen has started bleeding already have a bright line on the screen which is spreading with each passing day worst tv in this budget don t buy it go for other options not recommended at all i bought this product in october and the installation date given was month later yet the technician had no mood to install it further the television worked fine for months and one fine day its screen display went dark we thought it was a tata sky set talk box issue but later the other hdmi slot also went dark i have been calling amazon every single day to provide a warranty repair but for the past fifteen days they are not able to arrange a technician to visit us i m fed up calling and explaining the issue again and again i m now looking for a refund r else i will be forced to go to the consumer forum total waste of money got the tv in flash sale and in only month remote control stopped working asked for technical support the amazon guy came for inspection and found the remote control faulty and told that it will get replaced but did not get any replacement till date neither amazon is responding properly neither one plus is responding will suggest buying some other product from a local vendor to get support on an immediate basis picture quality is good look feel is good sound is tv build quality is goodonly gb memory is available out of gb oxygen play is useless apps take sec to openso much lag in tvtake sec to startapp close automatically because of lack of memorydidn t expect from oneplus for such a pover product go for realme tv pricing wise it is goodpicture quality is goodbut they using normal grade panellight weightsound level is low when compared to other smart tv segments in this price range like other brands mi realme vubluetooth wifi is the best featureswall mount should buy separatelyeven official oneplus wall mount is not available in online technician provides other brandthat is higher price than the oneplus approx if the right availability in oneplus brand that priced at only but bad luck it s not availableoverally speaker volume must be important to improve in upcoming oneplus tv susing a good grade panel gives lot more quality i think my schedule of my installation ws on may bt nobody came also nobody call me today on wn i call amazon they the person who ws on call otherside shows that they dnt hv any respect to customers he says person fr installation will came on total days delayed bt they dnt fell sorry fr this they say that if i open box warranty will go i will nt gt warrantythis ws gift fr smone it birthday ws on may i will hv to wait till may to see if tr is tv inside or something alse installation team did not show up on scheduled day had to keep calling to get the installation done mount was not provided for if charged mount for costs but the installation boy charged us for it installation agent was very rude arrogant and unprofessional wasnt ready to give us a reciept for the extra amount when asked service was the worstest from oneplus the tv got problem with the motherboard and for the repair service i was still waiting from august th more than months still waiting nothing happened everything was ok with the tv but never expect any service from oneplus customer support or oneplus when you call oneplus customer support you have to wait on the line for the whole day to get irresponsible answers from oneplus amazon will help you but i request please dont go for oneplus products worst customer support i have ever seen product is ok but one plus service is horrible yes i mean it its horrible i need some technical assistance as i m unable to connect my router with smart tv i requested couple of times to pay a visit and give demo unfortunately no one turned up till date giving lame excuses i m surprised if i have been treated like this within product warranty what i ll do after warranty exhausted one plus customer care is pathetic a major cause of concern please don t ignore this tv has couple of technical issue while mapping with other external device like lan bluetooth all pros excellent picture quality voice quality is good but needs go to settings and do setup to genre you watching i set it to sports for everything i bought it in annual sale and it is nice prodct under this price cons no bootup sound or beep when powered on or used remote so you have to press remote quite hard takes good minuts to boot up overall verdict satisfied with the picture quality and sound quality of product could use a notification sound to save my remote though amazon installation service is not great as they force you to purchase wall mount stand and charge the installation also the tv was delivered on time but it sat there over the weekend as the installation person could only come after days moreover they void your warranty if you go for diy installation or setup which is pretty easy to do strange from amazon picture and sound quality are good but occasional glitches with respect to frozen or slow response while content surfing this needs tv to be restarted to make it smooth again my mitv which is slightly cheaper works flawlessly in this aspect and oneplus has a lot to improve via software update maybe i wish i had read the review s on oneplus official facebook page people are complaining about the service providing by one plus now let me share what happens with me i bought this tv through amazon with amazon and one plus brand warranty now i am facing some issues with my tv i called the amazon service to fix my tv and i called them many many times and no one visit at my home to fix the tv to let you know i am living in delhi ncr not himalayas so when amazon is failed to do that they escalated my request to oneplus and now it s more than a month i am still calling them to fix my tv and every time they said we escalated your request to related department kindly wait for days to visit the technician and after days you called they again saying the same thing again and again it s really frustrating so i suggest don t go with one plus tv i was bit worried about the lag reported by some reviewers fortunately i did not face any problems the picture quality is very good sound is also good menu options work well except voice commands which i couldn t get running couldn t have asked for more at this price point highly recommended update got the voice recognition running great performance i am really afraid about purchasing the tv because of the negative reviews i have seenbut after i have bought the product i am so satisfied with it and i must not have bothered negative reviewsthe picture quality is good mines an sd connection it would be awesome with a hd connectionmany said the sound is bad but i don t see it like that because at of the sound everyone at my home in any room of the houseyou need the adjust the sound at sound settings for better sound with the dolby given the sound is fascinatingit is good budget tvbought it along with alexamine is a remote location but got the installation done right the next day after the item has been received bad sound quality bad picture quality really regret my decision choosing this tv go for some real brands this is chinese scrap taking forever to load apps like youtube prime video everytime it starts fresh taking few mins to load even you turn off in remote the installation executive charged me rs cash for wall mounting brackets since they are not included in the price of the tv this information should have been clearly mentioned on the product description but it was not also initially i was very disappointed with the sound output of the tv the installation executive said that this is the best possible but later when i adjusted the sound settings from the menu the sound output increased dramatically led tv y series y tv worked ly for days contacting customer care for more than and half month no one came to repairi bought this one plus led tv this th october through amazon the worked properly only for days then display stopped working only audio is coming since then i am contacting customer care regularly everytime they say within next to hours technician will contact me but no one contacted me i asked phone number of technician but they say they don t have for past one and half month i am contacting customer care for more than times still same reply but nothing was done my location is urban area only selling very poor quality tv is one thing they can t even provide repair services in urban area very very worst product don t even think of buying it it s a old model tv you cannot get dual band frequency o the tv and if you need to do any this with picture quality the you will need to stop the movie and then go to service to resolve the issues other brand tv have better features than this old technology the tv s composite input went bad in less than a month of usage registered a complaint on the oneplus support site no response since then no calls emails or texts from oneplus support the visit date has come and gone and i have tried various methods to contact oneplus support email call chat without success the tv quality is below average there is a grey ghosting when the screen is perfectly black even on the android bootup screen sound is extremely poor i can never get rid of a boom in the tv speakers and the tv does not respond to the remote half the time my advice go for a well known brand with better service network it may cost more but you will be happier in the long run if you are on a budget look for other cheaper brands oneplus just does not have the quality assurance or the service network in place for their tvs update after i posted the above review i called oneplus support i had on hold waiting for a rep for a very long time close to minutes i think but finally got through the service person guided me through doing a reset of the tv and to my surprise it fixed the composite input issue i also think the sound has improved a bit so the software appears to be a little buggy but the tv is in usable state now very bad service provide by amazon tv is fill with lot of issue like choromecast startupamazon is not returning this product once deliver if your product also have faults poor service by amazon the media could not be loaded i m using this oneplus tv since more than a month now and so far all is good and fantastic picture quality is really good people are complaining for sound quality and power but i ve found it adequate i will say yes for this product if you re looking for something similar poor sound and lags too much nice android tv with a nice display great for streaming youtube disney hotstar netflix and amazon prime cec features work quite well hdmi content also displays great sound quality is very good does not break even on louder settings overall quite good product got the tv in may by july it started giving issues and by september it completely stopped working after sale is horrible we were told panel is spoilt need to change it s the end of november one plus hasn t even bothered to do anything extremely disappointed with amazon also as i complained multiple times with screenshots but at no avail to start with the weight is definitely light hence easy to install on a wall good decent picture quality for the money one spends on it can t expect clarity like expensive one on this now the down sides of this android tv the sound quality is bad dialogues can t be heard sometimes and you really have to crank up the volume to an irritable level remote is definitely not the most responsive of the lot each button needs to be pressed couple of times while pointing at the right direction for it to work speak function is worst absolutely non usablebuy only if you use your television seldomly plz help regarding my tv one plus y series i need replacement becoz tv have issue in hdmi port pictures are flipping and one plus doesn t have parts waiting from last weeks while i ordered recently this one new tvit get resolved and fully appreciated the media could not be loaded guys this was by far the best purchase i have made my wife is a plus fanatic so i purchased this thinking it won t be that good to my surprise the out put till now has been amazing there is slowness here and there while updating but that s normal for this price this tv does not disappoint premium look and premium quality the media could not be loaded don t buy this tv worst experience bought it only months back when it was launched but now the screen display is flickering and stuttering the oneplus service team is so poor that they could not even respond properly oneplus may be a good brand for high end mobiles but not for any other consumer goods i just want some technician to arrive at my place to sort the issue out no one is responding properly service team sets a bad example for oneplus oneplus service team is not like for samsung or any other big brands their network is so small that they can t provide the service on time and in many areas tv is good light weight and easy to use it is so light that i have to go to the warehouse to pick that up because the delivery person says he can t come to deliver and he was okay if i complain i got the tv after almost days when it had reached the warehouse and the best part the delivery team were not even concerned about it i just walked in after so much frustration and picked the tv and then i got a msg on my phone saying your order is out for delivery i hope amazon does take some action tv is ok for use don t expect too much from oneplus i expected a lot more from tv like oneplus phones pros good picture quality not better software is user friendly connectivy is fast responsive remote st time faced lag after updated it solved cons low sound response of voice command is a lit more lag viewing experience is not as good view get better quality but in showing a shadow tv mirroring is difficult this tv has really really by the picture quality the grey uniformity of the screen is really very bad even worse than a lot of much cheaper tvs the viewing angles are also the worst i have ever seen in a tv the sound is very very bad and i wouldn t recommend this tv to anyone despite the android tv advantage this tv is much worse compared to tv which cost half of this i ordered new tv considering my old tv would be exchanged but delivery guys rejected it on ground that there are some marks on screen my question why would i exchange new tv from amazon when the reason for which i ordered was not satisfied advise stop cheating people on name of exchange as your guys will come and request pls pay the difference amount and take the products etc no point in going for exchange i could have gone without ordering a new tv with my older lg which is working fine till now exchange is tactic to fool customers in past also same has happened with mobile also at that time i rejected the order but this time i was trapped due to presence of family and kids wall mount was not provided by technician during installation since they did not have stock and now i m asked to pay for wall mount brackets isn t this something that will be provided by technician during installation for trying to adjust for technician request for handing the wall mounting bracket later i ve to pay extra price this isn t something expected from amazon i buy one plus tv with high expectations but not good picture and sound quality good one plus led tv hdmi not working last month no service centre no response for one plus tv any service person come he tell just u r hdmi port not working wecannot handle and we cannot repair last month i cannot seeing my entertainment my suggestion pls think and buy money not come easy please bhiayon dhyan de mere sath dhokha huya hai mujhe nahi pata tha ki ismain screen monitering nahi ho pati hai yadi koi bolta hai to wo sirf jhuth bol raha hai iske liye ghar main do phone hona jaruri hai or phone main internet bhi hona chahiye nahi to connect nahi hoga miracasting not connecting easyly screen monitoring connection very poorproduct feture not acceptable this item i have been an one plus fan since i got the one plus t upon a lot of convincing my dad finally trusted a one plus tv as he is traditionally a fan of samsung panasonic and other established tv s the one plus tv not only has impressed him but the prompt installation and customer support has helped increase his faith in an otherwise new company coming to the tv the picture quality is amazing and the voice recognition along with alexa works like a charm despite many negative reviews on the sound quality i found it satisfactory and absolutely upto the mark i dont need any external speakers as the sound quality is damn good coupled with a good high speed wifi this tv is a steal at this price other smart led tv s are k expensive and with no other notable increase in any features as i have seen in many of my friends homes oneplus has done a commendable job with this product great picture quality with good sound best in its segment don t go for youtube reviews i think that s the drama made by the youtubers on reviewing this product this product has nice built quality as well only thing is you need to update its firmware when you connect to internet for the first time because picture quality is not as good as after update the media could not be loaded it is completely budget tv picture quality goodaudio quality poorremote and voice recognize averagethere is no audio output for old home theatresbuild quality not that greatno wallmount we need to pay extra rs while installing worst wall mount it is not slim tvpathetic installation service first of all i was in dilema that tv will in good condition or not but than i purchased it and its out of the expectation deleivery was fast installation was on time and cool features and also its pocket friendly product overall experience its an awesome star thums up i purchased tv but in a month when i connected amazon fire stick i realized the arc hdmi port was not functioning i filed complaint to oneplus first and amazon then the technician never visited my home after his only first visit in nov always made false reporting always rescheduling and cancelling visit appointments and even after then just updating waiting for parts i thank amazon who accepted return of my television in january and till th march he was making false reporting ultimately i told him about my return of television and he ended the service i have to surrender a good television just a small defect because of the pathetic service later i purchased hisense a f from flipkart with years complete protection plan of flipkart my oneplus tv also had a extended warranty protection policy i changed tv brand and purchase app just because of this service i hope this feedback will take some measures which will benefit your future customers oneplus is a brand what i know it gives premium quality product but in this y series tv of inches its not upto the mark i will rate by its performance product it good but performance is not upto the mark if i compare to mi tv as in same segment infact its performance is comparatively more better than oneplus tv issues what i am facing when you will power on the tv first it shows blue screen for seconds i don t kniw why performance is low it tooks overall second to start completely while give indication to power on by your remote you will not to know is it actually on or off because it takes around second to show response if you are restless person then this tv is not for you i recomend personal but all these software kind of issue it may be resolved over updated maybe but for now i dont want to go with this oneplus y series tv i am not percent satisfied or next its your call whether you want to go with this product or not oneplus is a good brand but this y series may bring it down good panel damaged within months of purchase less than hour of daily use on average the company doesn t have spare parts available have been asked to wait months for panel replacement better off buying vu tv much better picture quality reliability and service availability tv got delivered in good condition and installation went wellcoming to the tv picture quality it s awesome got all ott applications had a problem with oneplus connect app connecting to tvi have seen many complaining about sound but in my opinion its crazy i want to tell u guys thing if you want theatre experience go to theatre its a tv not a sound system so stop complaining about sound at last go for it dont change your mind on other companies and waste timeas these r my early days ill update abt the tv again after a monthupdatesound and picture quality are crazyoneplus connect app is laggyhaving issues with screen mirroring hoping for the update directly but i have no issue with screen mirroring from youtube prime applicationssupports rd party applications alsoas the ram is low it takes time to load apps once cache is formed apps open at good speedri now best tv in budget segment installation team took days after delivery it is bluetooth remote but sometimes it won t work we have to use it as ir remote tv is very slow to operate and apps crashes frequently connecting mobile remote is a hectic process even if you change color mode in tv it will work with default color settings while watching tv through av port poor panel quality the media could not be loaded i am writing this review after months of usepurchased on jan pros good picture quality color gamet is really working you can see vibrant color on screen fully satisfiedaudio audio is ok for one single room and ya ofcourse dolby sound is also working nicedesign bazzle less design will attracts attention while tv is on or off it looks very good like a modern smart tvcons vertical line on screen after months of use i got single vertical line on screen which is very disappointing for a brand one plus tv was ideal on wall and one day i saw a vertical line next day i got lines and now as you can see in the picture there are bold lines on the screen i have called to customer care and no response after week remote voice command is not working from very first day of installation but that was ok in front of screen fault you have to pay rs as a installation charge for inch tv writing this review after using it for a month i am using this as just smart tv not with any cable connection or dth service sharpness gets set to automatically out of no where and u will watch your tv playing everything in black white and once this happens tv never works the same as before picture quality is not so great tv gets hang in all the applications it ll go back to initial screen while you are watching something sometimes it works as radio you play some video but u can only hear it and entire screen will become blank amazon warranty claim service is pathetic i ve raised a request and waited for days still no technician had visited from oneplus to provide service and amazon doesn t have any information regarding that simply they offer this service as per the scheduled installation date technician not reported after days also it s not done finally we have arranged technician from local area fixed it fast delivery sound picture quality good price ok service no service team in odissa after receive the material we wait for install it week but nobody reached for installation finaly arranged technician from out side fixed itwe never expect that the poor service from amazon team please don t buy this scrap product i came to know i wasted after days of usage if you buy this definalty you will loose piece of mind sad story starts now i am writing review after days of usage product got delivered on th feb and installation is done on th feb days after delivery i can t able to use tv without wall mounting because of limitations at my home basic functionality display is lost after days of usage i could not able to return because of return policy of days of delivery return button is disabled initially i thought it was setup box problem that after troubleshooting i came to conclusion that it was tv display problem sad story continues i raised a complaint to amazon th march they told that they will send a technician to check problem and scheduled appointment is on march now i have wait for days to technician to come and inspect brand value of oneplus in mobile category is good when it comes to tv oneplus made a scarp product if basic functionality display is not working as expected its brand value is zero coming to amazon i didn t buy a product on road side platform didn t expect worst service from amazon for scrap product inspection after days after complaint sad story continues don t know if amazon will help me or not i had ordered this tv as a gift for my sister after days their is a black line appear on the screen and after some hour whole screen became black and nothing can be seen on the screen now we can only hear the sound with this tv because it happens after days so amazon refused to give us replacement and suggest us to contact with oneplus now oneplus taking its own time to decide whether they will give me a new replacement or they will repair this crap don t know how much time they will take we faced a lot of issue with the tv everything related to tv is good but the smart part really is disappointing we have to wait minutes before the tv turns on google assistant is not responsive most of the time not a smooth experience and just for reference my internet speed is mbps will recommend you all buy a normal tv and use amazon firestick instead firestick is smarter than the smart tv by one plus i love oneplus products and i hve a device bullets as wel tv all there products r too good n i will surely recommend all my frndz and family members to purchse tv dolbby version in tv has got a amazing audio effects i am proud to tell all my frndz dat am an oneplus user and own it never expected dat i would really feel so comfortable using tv also there z a very good quick response form customer service also itz easy to book a repair frm oneplus care app as world z becoming smarter even booking a repair z so simple by using user friendly app and the technician repairs it in front of our eyes which is really amazing and happy to tell woooow and a big salute to oneplus brand cheers manjunath rey the media could not be loaded purchase this during amazon sale for my room and it s an excellent tv have been using it for more than a month now and there have been not any issues such pros amazing clarity amazing sound for a small room chrome cast or casting works neatly all the apps work extremely fine the bluetooth remote is extremely good and there is a knack to use this it gets switched off due to inactivity so if you want to quickly turn on your tv you ll have to press on the power on button twice with a gap of to seconds in between cons there is a lag while starting the tv and some apps voice recognition take some time lags do happen because you re paying not a big price for a tv like this which is feature loaded so i feel this is worth the buy picture quality is bad may be some defect never experienced like this from oneplus product earlier as i am fan and mad about the brand but this product proved that oneplus is also doing the same gimmicks like others slowly loosing their never settle tag worst packaging damaged box completely wet on wet tv has a lag will not response to the remote and even crashes and freezes sometime light bleed from the frame dark patches on the screen if your ceiling fan is running forget about the tv output sound worst output hard to hear worst amazon customer service no technical knowledge and always demand for pictures and disconnect the call amazon declined to replace and offered refund of as against k which i paid for the tv after waiting for days and even brought pre book deal from acko and cashback and alexa customer service simply says product is not available for replacement cancel and take refund of never thought of writing a negative feedback on oneplus brand is loosing its value i will strongly say worst product from oneplus and worst service from amazon amazon delivery very fast received next day but installation is cumbersome the technician neither called me or came for installation on the scheduled day when i called him he will send someone for installation i am watching the tv on table stand only drawback of the product is lag in every step picture quality is marvelous but sound quality is not clear and upto the mark considering the cost the product is perfect after reviewed month i m sharing this details first impression is voice recognise is working very quickly and software updates got time when time of unboxing only very light weight and good sound speakers wi fi receives good singals strength and very fastly moving through remote operates android os is not bad using oneplus android app manage easily tv completely awesome this product cons using bluetooth headphone connected to tv sound is not good and something noise happening i m a big fan of oneplus products and i was so happy when they announced the tv y series i pre ordered it on the first day itself but later i ve realised that it was the biggest mistake the oneplus trademark of quality doesn t applicable on the this y series it feels like they have just put oneplus logo on some cheap quality tv i m getting regular issues with the tv if i claim for service the person comes and resets the tv and says everything it good and after days same issue happens st issue the screen went blank and only audio came without video nd issue video stuck and audio continues and remote doesn t work rd issue sometimes remote doesn t work th there is some little gap in between the outside panel and the screen and when i showed it to the service person he says it is normal due to sensors present that gap is visible but there is no sensor present in the middle th user interface sucks th bluetooth connectivity issue multiple times i reported and the service person comes and resets the tv and leave th connectivity b w tv and remote is the worst all the time the tv sucks do not go for it if you want a tv in the budget go for mi or realme oneplus y series is worst in the entire oneplus lineup picture quality is not good black is like brown and sound quality is very very poor i suggest you do not buy after installation and using one month i noticed that there is a problem with the android tv it s automatically turned off some time its hang no function is working i have to restart again if you re having a good budget then go ahead with the other brands this is my personal opinion but i find this tv is not reliable sir i have buyed it last few days in starting four to five days its working perfectly and now its gonna blur video quality and not happy with this product if company has send their executive to check it so its good otherwise it not a good and there is no customer support from this product also sir i m trying to cl again and again but there is not a good response from their side please pay attention regarding this and resolve this problem as the earliest screen problem disappears automatically sound problem not cleared wifi connection connection gone automatically nd shows no connectivity picture quality suddenly shows black nd white pictures i suggest don t buy it if u think it s one tv disappointed so much i brought this tv at the republic day sale and i regret taking this tv let me start with the good points about the tv the sleek and bazel less design user interface is pretty good pain points the installation experience has been pathetic and i in fact got it after a week of follow up and complaint raising the tv is terribly slow the booting of the tv takes a lot of time and screen to screen lag time is very high in the first week itself the google assistant stopped working and i raised further complaints the service guys then said that they will replace the remote but till now no further response the colour and contrast combinations are pretty bad the media could not be loaded full waste of money requesting everyone please do not buy one plus company tv after buy my tv within one month screen automatically damaged and it will repair by one plus next two months and there customer care executives are always give u a fake promise attachment video for your reference was shocked to receive product with no plastic covers it was all covered in dust inside tv stands plastics were removed there were no screws present scratches on tv back panel remote was also looking used i got the feeling that may be they sent me display unit but amazon was so prompt after i sent them pictures and coordinated on call with them they immediately arranged for reverse pick up and i refund got initiated in hours perfect choice a small lag for remote in simple words its a perfect choice and value for money easy to install more simple than using a mobile phone voice assist is not tested since android phone is required for that please go ahead with your choice the tv is excellent no issues with the same however the installation of the tv leaves a lot to be desired the technician deputed to do the installation are ill equipped to do the same they do not have proper tools or bits for the installation and are in a hurry to leave they have little no knowledge of the features in the tv and seem ignorant there standrard reply is see the video on youtube dissapointed with the installation had to get the same installed privately by making payments other than that the tv is good worth the price i am very disappointed with the service amazon provided i purchase oneplus y series tv within months tv screen gone when i request for warranty on june and asking for solution they just escalate the issue no resolution till date the product must replaced with the new product if you not able to fullfill the service good i regret buying this oneplus tv i just bought your inch tv last week or so thro amazonlast couple of days i find that the tv uis having some problemwhen i am watching channels suddenly it goes off to the home screen it is not coming coming backnow i regret buying your tv their after sales is very poor to attend a call they ask me to wait for mins my god the tv was ok for months and then the remote stopped working got it replaced and now the tv doesbt turn on or off from remote the tv hangs often and needs to be rebootedas much as i love my phone i hate the tv this was a waste of money third class tv never recommend to buy this one to anybody atleast times have to press start button to start the tv very irritating not sure how log this tv will last bad choice product i thought like one plus mobile tv quality will also be fine tv is basic speakers are average and need to get external soundbar installation delayed and not happened yet also it doesn t support g internet so not sure if it can stream high quality videos i have purchased oneplus tv tv is good bt tv is panels problem i will contact oneplus budgets tv just didn t like the product as it is not working properly this is the first time that i am really disappointed by amazon and one plus but one time is enough from now onwards amazon will be the last resort to buy the things as well try to buy from showrooms or flipkart if something won t be available somewhere then only will do business with amazon after being a loyal customer for years never expected that amazon will treat me like this thanks for screwing up things bought this product last year in july from the start it had picture quality issues and the tv was very slow and laggy in the first months spots developed on the tv which resultef in changing the entire display for a new one and now i m having problems with the startup of the television it is just showing the logo of plus and then switching off didn t expect such a product from a trusted brand like oneplus the main problem with it is not its speakers but the software support being given its software is very laggy and buggy with bugs which are never fixed it might receive software updates but the bugs are still there every time if you turn the tv off with remote it turns on again on its own sometimes you have to press the power button several times to turn it on if you switch between apps extensively it gets slowed down and lags till you restart it takes several seconds to power on overall it has bad speakers and bad software display is good but you have to tweak it a bit because it is so saturated so spend some more money and don t buy this product did not expect from one plus worst experience ever all of sudden video went into black and white and also one black lane was observed on the screen technician came and concluded that both back pannel and display got spolied i raised a complaint and fighting with customer care almost months and exchanging the mails lot of drama happened finally they replaced the new tv hope it goes few months can t suggest you to buy this tv please think twice before you are going to buy writing the reviews after months of usage tv on off with the remote doesn t happen in one shot tv gets crashed often for tha last days tv has become black and white i have raised a compliant for which there is no proper response and they are not ready to provide replacement as well need help from amazon with in month wi fi is not working tv restarting again and again service request logged on april but still no one is attending this call one false technician was allotted for this call but when i call to technician he told that is not working with this company from last month i had mailed to one plus customer care but nothing happed till date absolutly stunning oneplus did a great job picture quality awesome imersive sound is literallty more than enough for a large hall bass sourround sound loudness and quality is just great if you turn the volm to max you are going to feel as if a large saadi wala dj is in your room google assitant blutooh pairing screen cast all installed apps works seamlessly no laging issues at all bezels are extremely thin if you watch tv from a distance you cant say even tv has bezels or not build quality is just great tv is very light weight one word review best value for money literally the media could not be loaded first product receive there was a line coming in the screen so tried for replacement installation took three days tried for a replacement and again wait for week to deliver product deliver now waiting for installation days already passed dont buy from amazon they have worse installation facility and also they will take very much time instead go for sony it is best instead of mi one plus or lg remote is not working faster if you use frequently performance is good even it has a good clarity i m giving it stars cuz of the poor service i have been complaining since one month after the purchase of the product it still has an issue with wi fi connectivity as well as bluetooth connectivity it started just after a month of purchase and i have complained it for time even still there is no response at all now it even has an issue with ethernet cable ie even after connecting ethernet cable it s showing as no internet it has such a poor customer service worst must prefer offline lot of hectic procedure also display was faculty picture gets blur anytime and it s stuck for secs first of all one star for amazon not for tv from buying to installation every thing is pathetic first if you want to buy this item u should have prime membership first condition after becoming the prime member tv is delivered after seven days it s a joke from amazon and it shows that they don t take their prime members seriously and i have to wait for freaking days for insatallation then that insatallation guy really he is a fraud he charged me rupees for wall mount and before coming for installation he asked there is two wall mount one is local of rupees and another one is from one plus of rupees so i choose the one which is from one plus which is doubt full one plus should add wall mount barcket in the box so these fraud installation guy can t receive any one after amazon doesn t take the liability of this they said that this is the genuine price and i doubt it because he didn t bring the wall mount bracket in retail box and making excuse that he don t have enough space in his bag this is the first time i am buying anything from amazon and i buy disappointem not a tv from amazon again thanks amazon for this shipment experience now for tv is ok picture quality is decent but sound is not that great it s loud but not clear it could have been better connectivity is good just like everyone is saying that tv lags not in my case remote work superb no lags and everything else is ok bad product no value for money i have bought the tv on oct on amazon great indian festival sale and my honest comment is slowness while using android and chromecast poor audio quality when wifi is switched on then tv automatically off and change from cable or antenna to android so again we have to use the tv remote and change it back to cable youtube crashed some time so we have to switch off and switch on it again good product panel quality and sound is good for the price it is worth smart functions can be bit overwhelming for some but overall good experience android tv options are good even though youtube may take but time to load and search still highly recommend with my days only use the panel just went kaput one fine day fortunately during warranty period amazon took ages to even respond even escalation was handled poorly every amazon agent only after getting good ratings without any useful action brand responded in two days to depute a service person more than a week later one plus says they do not have replacement parts in stock and do not even know when they will be available typical chinese product buy at your own risk in their association even amazon has got spoilt in this product one plus android led it is having problem when you see picture from other angle instead of straight and it is not possible your all members can sit only infront of screen straight position only when you will sit lightly side or side angle then colour will see fade same problem was in previous piece and i replaced this and new piece delivered on april but same problem in this i will recommend to all never buy this product because this is a manufacturer defect and will lodge the compliant in my warranty may be amazon will help for correcting this brought a tv it worked for days and then the tv dsnt wana turn on never expected this kind of thing from one plus very poor also the best part is they have many complaints like that coming for this model its so evident that knew there is some issue with this model of product and its still its out for sale and now i am being waiting for a tech to visit me from days guys this is for any one who is buying this particular product plese please think twice i dnt knw anything abt other product though this model of tv has some problems not worth the humiliation and tension have been using oneplus tv for more than months now excellent purchase good picture quality good audio output great features since its android you can install apps from built in google playstore app in the tv i use an iphone no issues while casting mobile to tv screen the only thing i dislike is that it sometimes glitches while switching between apps hope oneplus fixes it soon with updates an excellent tv in this price range go for it changing my review after months firstly it does not start normally as you have to wait for a whilesecondly after it starts it goes to home screen by its ownalso poor display and sound quality cheap panel and its not oneplus brand quality moreover its remote stopped working now writing a review after months it s working absolutely fine picture quality is good and it s a perfect buy in the price i tried to connect on g but didn t happen but g also works great so i didn t bother to call the technician installation was quick and paid only for wall mounting which was around never expected this from amazon and from one plus after months of usage screen started flickering and complaint registered on amazon and one plus during dec st week its been one month over still the issue is not resolved thank you amazon for not taking the customer complaints on time thank you one plus for not valuing your customers please dont but anything from amazon the media could not be loaded i have bought one plus inch smart tv in june and within a month it s screen is completely malfunctioning please see the attached images as well as the video of my tv i was not expecting this from amazon i want a new replacement for my tv it is very pathetic and annoying user experience for me overrall it s ok however i have seen it s lagging some times when using remote there is no support provided by one plus from product feature handling explanation perspective this should be included while aligning engineer for installment else person like me have to keep calling every time to customer care net to net not good experience with service front timely delivey and spot istalation great purchasing expericince by amazoni expect one plus mobiles range quality in tvs also first reason for i buying it for one plus image after using this tv some two weeks i satisfied prosgood picturegood soundgood remoteconssome apps dirict to access but browsing is little bit confusing for children online classes not much usable tv started showing issues just on th day amazon is now paying games saying its other departments who is handling this we can not replace as its more than days i raised calls times they say they will get back in hours no one responds don t buy or any electronics from amazon as u will not get u r warranty sorted cons tv display quality is bad sound is bad tv do not wake up from standby with key press amazon service sucks no response date th augustvery very pathetic display quality even hd channel is not clear colour spread all over the places completely blurry display sound is also poor very noisy sound quality this isnt expected from one plus contacted amazon they said tv can t be returned on the basis of display quality felt cheated and for one plus lovers a big disappointment date th augustafter inspection by amazon authorised agent the return has been accepted thank god i got rid of this mess just got my tv delivered installation went on well and it worked fine till the service person was giving demo the time he left screen stopped working and i could only hear the voice and with the screen in black tried to connect it in all possible ways and finally with decided to register a complaint hufff this is a big task again no one responds to the calls and after a fightback of hours finally they registered my complaint and scheduled for technical evaluation after days worst experience and worst service i dont recommend such irresponsible company products got this product delivered on th nov by march the device became faulty contacted amazon customer service and they promised to send a technician within hrs unfortunately no one contacted us or came to us for servicing the device so contacted the customer care again and received the same reply that they will send the technician within hrs today a person rang me from oneplus and said that the technician will come within a week so whom should i believe before this incident i had huge admiration for oneplus but now if any one asks me i will not recommend oneplus everytime i switch on the tv i need to change date and time to today s time so that the tv works else it won t be connected to wifi i have called multiple times the oneplus executive but they also couldn t do anything and give some false promises i tried calling oneplus for replacement but they denied i don t what is the issue here moreover even after changing remote times i cannot switch on the tv with the remote i always need to switch on the tv from behind the tvworst experience with the tv just horrible the price for this product is good but the disadvantage in this tv are poor remote signal unable to connect mobile to tv sound quality high lag in systemnot recommended to buy worst tv ever to buy manufacturing defect in the replaced product also and one plus denies to agrees for it and asking for repair of the product fruad even amazon is denying the promise made to me to provide free of cost service after making promising me for service for whole one month fraud by amazon n oneplus never buy products from amazon n one plus tv is not even switched on i have raised the request on aug but still din t get resolved my problem then i created request from one plus tv service itself but there also no response the not even responding worst service from one plus please don t buy it data saver mode is absent from my tv this is the biggest setback for me although they are still showing data saver mode in product description on amazon hope they fix this in their update it s hangs a lot and it has only been less than a month every tv is basically the same these days all the features are good except that the remote is terrible and it hangs a lot ui not smooth as they shown less ram less internal storage makes ui worst don t buy for oneplus brand only after sale service not good as their phones for that same price iffalcon k tcl brand k gb memoryespecially no lagging the media could not be loaded the products wireless card started to malfunction just after months of purchase and worst is that the oneplus customer care doesn t even bother i have raised the complaint and it has been days i don t have any response from oneplus care team they just ask me to wait for few days worst customer care ever i would not recommend people to go for oneplus although the price is very tempting but if we don t get any after sea support this is of no use sony and samsung are way better though they charge a premium the media could not be loaded don t buy this oneplus tvonplus lost my trusti bought inches tv on th january but it s not working from th january oneplus have the worst service they are not proving any service to the customers i was calling to the service center from last days but they are not giving any response this is the worst tv and worst service to the customers there is no service center in warangal even it is nd biggest city in telangana after hyderabad online service and local services are also worst in oneplus don t go for oneplus because they are not providing any service to their customers i am reviewing the product after using it for months till now the performance of the tv is good enough pros good picture quality sound is also good enough cools looks good featurescons sometimes works slow software glitch happens sometimes need to power off on to deal with itoverall a good tv to purchase at this price i got inch version good at this price point i had to replace it once the first tv i got was on older os version updated on jun this was buggy and had lot of issues can t update the os update was not working i wasn t able to add google account youtube was not workingbut the replacement i got had new os version updated on sep and it resolved all above issue it seems good and stable enough but still software improvements are needed i am happy with sound quality and picture quality well good enough as per this price point the media could not be loaded worst product from one plus getting grains in the picture within months is it worth buy for k compare other products are better no response from service also don t buy useless product if you re remote conks then no replacement available even if you want to pay and buy oneplus keeps saying that they don t have it in stock so buy at your own risk the media could not be loaded the tv is overall perfect picture quality and sound the only question over here is of reliability i bought this tv on september but facing problems with it since then and when i raise a complaint it starts working fine automatically and magically it occurs again after month faced the issue again last week and this time the issue still existed when the service person came please see the video attached and decide this video was taken by the service technician that visited overall i rate this tv star because if reliability dont buy this tm if you are looking for good display i connected this to my laptop and the quality of the display is so bad you can clearly see pixel and it is blurr its only good for sound and app feature not for display tv not working from day two onward contacted one plus through amazon for service no res ponce from company side and amazon side also finally they cancelled service requesttv with me but not working waste of moneydon t buy i had a lot of expectations but iam disappointed the picture and sound quality is good but the software is very very very bad maybe because it s just gb ram it s gets stuck intermittently it gets shutdown on its own it keeps coming out of the apps like youtube on its own tv display is damaged in day i can understand in machinary it happen but after one month brand is not repair it this is the concern i have reached to amazon they also not helped and say we are not responsible brand will give resolution on this i am waiting waiting and waiting when techinician will can and repair if it will not resolved in next days then last option is consumer court remote is not working properlypoor picture qualityworst soundan entry level tv where you don t mind quality never expected worst product form company like one plus do not buy this product as it s quality is worst there are bugs small insects ants entering into the display and roaming freely inside it please see the picture i attached with this review i am trying to contact customer care for last days but no reply from their side as well i feel like i have wasted on this product worst ever after days of purchase tv is not starting raised issue in amazon and they denied service raised to they are also making excuses since complaint raised still counting days and no one has shoen up till now more than a month passed since complaint raised picture quality was goodsoftware running smoothlylike it very muchbut within a day display started problems like flickering white may be i got defective product i think so i returned it i bought the tv on october and intalled on th october but on december th the tv showed display error and i requested a service via amazon but literally there was no response form them for these three days it has everything to offer in this price range but the only issue i see in the device is it is slow something that i can t even change the application or go back to the menu again but that occurs like or times a day other than that i guess its a very nice product in this price range tv was very good in terms of picture quality sound is manageable to some extent internal featutes and wifi everything works pretty good in remote two of the buttons were not functioning but voice wise it is able to recognize but tv is quite lacking the media could not be loaded my opinion is to not buy this tv why because i have faced an issue with the wifi connection as it disconnects automatically as shown in the video i have changed it once under warranty but after a couple of weeks the issue still exists so go for mi or realme smart tvs oneplus is lacking in their quality and services if you have any other go to sell the product please go ahead and buy something useful two conditions faced in last days wifi connection in tv is not stable same wifi in other tv and devices won t give problem however in plus tv it keeps on disconnecting often shows home screen without pressing any button on remote while binging shows over internet good tv was not what was shown in the description whole plastic body was looking very cheap besides the rate was also cheap but at first i thought one plus would not deliver cheap product even at cheap price but i was proved wrong i returned the tv as there was some technical issue where tv was showing blue screen when turned on after few hours in standby mode and only solution was to turn it off completely and then again turn on so finally i decided to get rid of the tv and as there was no replacement available i got a refund writing this review after months don t buy this tv the quality for display is very poor i m using oneplus and vu tvs when comparing with oneplus vu tv s display quality is far far better and i got bright and dark spots in display after months of usage i ve called for service it is more than a week but no response from the service team there are still asking for more time better go for vu don t bought this onle plus tv some features are not working mobile mirror voice assistance so i have sent replace request after that replacement i got defect damage product refer enclosed pic now a days amzon selling worst product i am experience few products recently i ordered this during the festival sale this product was delivered and installed on time coming to the product the hdmi ports were not working properly one port wasn t working at all and i was seeing a pinkish screen on the other port amazon didn t let me replace the tv and i had to reorder the tv at higher price than before the new tv was delivered after more than days and the installation date provide was one week after that so for getting a working tv i had to wait for days the service provided by amazon during this festival sale was no where near the mark set up by them previously product was very good but had worst blasting speakers one plus does not have good customer service for tv since it was manufacturing defect amazon took return else one plus customer service was non existent learnt a big lesson better to spend k more and go for samsung poor quality tv at low cost poor display poor sound quality extremely slow procesor you can not see the tv for long time not a eye friendly delivered with damage display returned the same amazon should stop selling poor quality product to maintain their quality standard oneplus has rolled out a perfect tv like it s phones good picture quality display ui and remote direct option to switch to youtube netflix primevideo the google assistant works perfectlyneed bit improvement in sound quality best pacy in least price it is one plus no need to write anything picture quality is good everything is good it comes with android you will never get this type of product in this prise tag i m making this statement after through market research but internal video player could be better it never resumes your playback overall im fully satisfied and happy with my decision picture quality is okayish no ghz connection support audio quality is so poor that you may want to return the tv back installation is poorly done by rd party service costs for wall mounting i would suggest to add some more money and go for samsung sony or panasonic don t get tempted by price poor quality from oneplus didn t expected that from the starting itself i e from april it started showing problem with light and some time hanging problem now no picture is visible only sound please send service engineer to repair it immediately my overall experience with the product for days it s very bad tv is not working properly remote doesn t work and you can t do anything about it picture quality is very poor you won t get replacement from amazon shell out extra k and purchase from reputed brands never ever dream to go for oneplus be cautious you will not get any product support from amazon and you have to live with a defective product visit a nearby showroom and purchase from them this is what i wish to do right now after living with a defective product atleast you don t need to worry about after sales support the product is good but there are few bugs in oxygen play every time you have to pair bluetooth speaker to connect which is annoying you are in unpair pair device loop often the picture quality and perfomance is best in class the software experience is seamless i am expecting these minor bug fixes in software update one of the best lcd tv at this price range update on my after sales support it is the worst after sales support that i ever experienced compared to other brands during pandemic took almost months to get my panel replaced the tv is really impressive in all aspects haven t tried the voice recognition and other smart features because it has just arrived happy with the delivery within two days of placing the order butter service by the providers are pathetic the scheduled installation date was fixed but nobody came for the installation though i don t need installation etc but just wanted to know the service but i am really very disappointed with the service by the service providers this is the slowest tv i ever used don t waste your money pathetic display clarity remote functions are dead slow amazon refused to offer hdfc cash back contacted many times amazon agents are irresponsible and still it is pending really worst service from one plus i have purchased just months before it s always internet connectivity issue i logged a complaint days before but still issue not sorted still saying we will come and we will resolve really i was not expecting this kind of support from oneplus it has failed in television catagory this is the worst smart tv that would be available in the market with just netflix hotstar and youtube installed the tv hangs takes ages to switch from one app to another picture and sound quality is poor remote stops working and the tv needs to be restarted to pair the remote again i am using this tv since two weeks my honest review one of the best picture quality and good designed like premium looks i could see may reviews about sounds quality my personal experience is sound is so good it was clear and there is no any noise the one part i faced the issue is screen mirroring it was very bad i unable to connect screen mirror with one plus connect application i am connecting through party app into one month everuthing was working fine but now the hdmi port got compliant it take days for amazon to arrange technician to come after that its now days till now waiting for spare parts to come hope everything will be covered by warranty edit its nov th still tv is not repaired even amzon customer care people dnt knw what to do with this warranty please dont buy this tv i purchased the product last month in diwali sale and overall i am satisfied with the product quality but in comparison to the other brand s like mi realme etc price is on the little higher side if the rice is a little bit lower side it will be a higher selling product i m received this tv on th june today is rd july still the installation team didn t came i have only more days to make replace if any issues on my schedule date that technician called me asking for money for installation here they mentioned free of installation next schedule is showing for th june and that is the last date to replacing option for this tv try to change the process otherwise please stop your brand best in this price range we can expect morei am using since of july undoubtedly picture quality is too good sound is also good as compare to other brands there is an issue while opening any app i think it will get optimized after next update that they are providing in september i am a prime customer and usually order all my electronics and other stuff from amazon and i am happy with the services one plus y series was a nice deal but during the order there was no clear guidelines for amazon eco dot offer and i ordered as per the details mentioned there but i did not get eco dot and i contacted customer care but they were also not able to get me the offer i am a prime customer but disappointed with my experience with this order i have read the terms and conditions during that time and it was not present and later on added by seller or amazon the screen cast is not supported by the tv it s been months for the tv and the display started to flicker with a black line vertically on the display further the repair return service against the warranty is not very customer friendly i ve been trying to avail the warranty service but no positive response received from the other side please don t make a mistake purchasing this device as mine stopped working within a month of purchase even the remote control is faulty and shuts the tv down just by pointing towards with without any button press the service centre guys will not respond to the complain for more than days they won t even respond either edited after month to year tv can t start without remote and remote is of such a dull quality which don t connect with tv after a lot of efforts lm genuinelynot recommended to anyone to buy this tv even if tv you got free of cost rs tv android but without wall mount no use ok quality bad experience this tv don t have any setting which could set hdmi any other input as default input so everytime to switch off on the tv you need to set the input to hdmi to tune to your dth setup box so your parents grand parents will find it difficult to use this tv this simple feature is available in every other competetior tv like mi sony tcl samsung etc its having software issue the date and time changes every time when we switch off the tvi was return and get another one but it is also same software issue i dont like this got the oneplus tv during deals and was delivered on time and its working as expected except the installation service which was bad though not necessary as we went ahead with setup on our own and its working fine as of now will post further reviews upon observing in a couple of weeks or months awesome product like you can t have a better tv in such low price no problem with my tv pehle we were scared ki tv agar kharaab aai to but delivery was awesome installation vas fab this tv is more than thousand in shops par yaha pr perfect aur budget friendly price hai loved it just go for it guys picture quality is amazing and sound system is also wonderful feel like ordinary tv not any more surprising from one plus brand picture quality it s unsatisfying major issues for unsatisfying for inch tv promotion through amazon actually size is different it s inch of measurement size from actual inch tv size i meant full screen and total tv size feel very very common and irdinery tv it s not look like a famous brand am sorry to say but this is a fact and feel thank youby manikandan k it s very worst product don t buy this product service is very very worst warranty claim also delay for the product tv spare parts not available customer service person also delayed for this issue attracted towards oneplus brand and bought this tv for k which was k higher than similar products in other brands from the day one usb port not working and the delay in technical service was horrible day after day rescheduling happens and irritating over no of phone calls replacement will be given after collecting the defective product by the time have already paid months emi very bad experience with amazon and pathetic one plus tv t v hangs and voice command does not work moreover free installation is a big lie technician who came to install the t v has no idea of android t v voice command instaed they forced us to buy wall mount saying it was mandatory we denied it as they were charging rs whose price in amazon is much lower very poor installation service we did it ourselves better options are available this tv is called smart tv but cannot connect to g and can t mirror cast freely you will have to buy google chrome cast for the same will recommend don t buy smart tv from amazon at least coz the worst product and service anyone can get from amazon will be this within one month the product stopped working and not getting any help from amazon just pathetic service and faulty product i would suggest please dont but oneplus tv which is terrible in terms of usage i am using from the last months and it got repair issue twice and service takes uptown month to repair the tv worst product i have ever seen in my life please dont buy from amazon as well i never expected to write a negative review for oneplus product i love oneplus but i hate that tv because poor build quality white edges on bottom of tv and screen flickering is the most common problem half of the times tv doesn t start with a single button press booting takes atleast seconds screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time system lag is the maximum in this class of tv s echo dot doesnt work with the tv as advertised and is awaiting a software update so buying an echodot as a bundled offer with the one plus tv is not helping the tvs picture quality can be a bit better and really not upto the mark as it is advertised the tv apps is a bit slow and hangs at times the remote functioning is not as agile comparing a vu or any typical brand overall not a pleasant experience and not expected from one plus i have a feeling oneplus is compromising on the quality at various ends nice product at this price quality of picture is very nice has got all the smart features voice recognition is also good for that make sure your internet is has good singnal sound quality is not good for that you have to buy sound bar i am giving this review after a month as if now i have not got any issue yet but at this price i will recommend to buy oneplus tv gap between frame and screen disappointing sound quality is very bad build quality is very bad the media could not be loaded there is no doubt about picture quality it s one plus product just go for it after apple one plus is the only company has most trustable about quality and performance i am planning to buy another one on next sale picture quality is good issues with sound quality but on customizing the sound from settings the sound quality improves a lot at this price point it is quite good if one is happy using youtube amazonprime netflix which are pre installed you are not going to face any issues of lag most importantly found made in india written on the back panel of the tv so one can prefer this product from other available at same price range the media could not be loaded product is good but pictury quality is not as expected i feel mi smart tv picture quality is better than this oneplus tv my opinion because some people feel that oneplus tv picture quality is better than mi tv connectivity is good it runs android with built in playstore one of the best smart tvs out there it isn t k but no compromise in the picture quality whatsoever just a little bit slow but again at this price point and other features the remote is great and voice recognition and google assistant works great it can be ignorable also the sound quality is enough to fill a decent hall chromecast and pairing devices are really smooth i seriously recommend you not to purchase one plus products tv in days it got problem with blank screen and flickering from last months i am behind customer care and service centre guys no one till the day is responding and even after more than mails sent to support team oneplus is not supporting any tv which is purchased fron amazon as they said sound quality needs to be improved and you can use hd only less than tb which is major disadvantage any usb device more than tb will not work good installation team supportive helpful it has very great picture quality rich sound and all of the smart features available in present it also has support for voice assistants like alexa and google assistant you can assign commands through your voice the tv runs on android tv operating system so apart from regular content you can stream content directly from other online platforms like netflix amazon prime and youtube it is a china product material and voice is worst than kids toy it hangs after days worst support for claim support team only wasting time warraty repair request automitically finished without service i m going to wait for a week otherwise going to throw this into dustbintoday on decamazon person telling that service to be provided by company and company technician without any service without clearing claim finished the claim ridiculous i bought this product because all my family members have plus phones but was very disappointed with the remote control the sensor is very poor i have to literally get up each time and go close to the tv about cms apart and use the remote which is really irritating they should work on this issue product of one plus tv was good but the customer service is worst of amazon if you buy a tv in amazon the installation will done for year or more days it will take and then they tell us to do installation of our nearby technician they tell us to give money to them we will pay you in amazon pay balance but also they doesn t pay and they always tell us update in hours something up to now it happened one month so i tell you to don t buy in amazon facing many lagssound voice is low back ground voices noisy nd disturbing while watching any showsdisplay little flickeringpicture more saturatedremote connectivity slowsuddenly it s restartsvery laggymany bugsone plus waste i ordered product aug but untill now no installation installation team will escape ny saying false statements so finally after days i got installation by my own amazon will provide money for installation just amazon pay balance no proper response from amazonbetter go for high end models sometimes apps or programs is strucking it will take time or we will switch off the tv to restart app will not not close automatically if another app is running some disappointed all features are good days remaining for my device warranty and its display is gets black worst experience with oneplus i brought this device because i am using oneplus pro mobile i it s customers service not even pick up my call very disappointed simple trick to hang the tv play any vedio on youtube off the tv frm remote on the tv frm remote the oneplus y series tv get hang noting works unless you unplugged and plugged in again plz try with your one plus y series tv and share your feed back the tv software is not properly tested and launch in market some time screen get blur only volumes come and pictures get hang it takes to sec to start waiting for any upgraded patch from oneplus expecting to be fixed with software upgrade picture and sound quality is good good to watch movies in in tv i bought an inch tv at price of k only draw back is sometimes is becomes slow or screen gets a lag and it came back to home screen no wall mount attached to this tv bad installation experience worst product dont buy this one i know its very cheap but plz dont waste your money its been the st night my remote is not being able to switch on the tv it lags hangsup many times a day sound quality is worst go for any other brand but not one plus never expected this third grade quality product there s even a colour fluctuation while playing the video sometime and its not even two days you will get what you pay for i had high hopes at first and ordered it through amazon the installation service by one plus is satisfactory but the television is where it all spills it will work properly for the first couple of months and then the experience gets really laggy the contrast is really bad and the sound quality is average it is a one time investment please go for sony or samsung by spending more but dont buy this stars out of worst tv worst customer service my tv stopped working with in two days due to some software issue service centre people also very unprofessional and dehradun service centre have no knowledge about tv softaware they are failed to resolve the issue which is still pending please dnt buy i am giving this review after using it for months but i am facing the issues from day one the tv hangs all the time and its really slow when i asked amazon to fix it i was told by the technician the system will update in few days and after that is will work properly after updating it twice its same dnt your waste money i thought its one plus brand so i bought it but regretting now sound the most disliked thing is the sound of y serie and one more thing is the speaker comes without tweeter its like local speakers voice picture quality good of value for money this comes for the ones budget under k oneplus connect is a lit bit laggyfull plastic body not a even metal used in the body i bought this television october within one year suddenly display dissapered that s ok it in warranty so i want to replace it but the worst part which is i dint expect from one plus is very worst service for television it s been months till now no repair just calling up customer service still they will never get back to me my serious recommendation is not to go for one plus tv and i will end tv looks premium and slim and very light weight voice it low than usual inbuilt speaker is too low even for small room you need to use extra bluetooth speaker but what else you expect in this price i got this in k which is serving purpose overall i am not at all satisfied with the picture quality also there is a fault in the remote not at all happy with the product the tv installation person came when the return window was closed this is not expected from amazon this is disgusting i want to return this product do not buy this product the dealer is delieviring old items from the godown i have purchased one it it s display is scratched when i call amazon customer help they denied to replace item and call me that you have to check when item is delievered that was so minor how can we confirm in once please by from the local shops istead of amazon the product was amazing picture quality was so good sound quality of the tv is good but the tv not connecting with the mobile and google assistant is of no use and it s not connecting to the device the wall mount was

experience from amazon and plus warranty support bad warranty service please don t buy it from amazon for their eye catching offers it always good to go n buy from your nearest shop don t buy this tv not even days display is gone poor service from amazon to claim warranty as long as all good amazon will be right choice if any problems they will not take care on the priority it s been days no action taken by them same i have been seeing from other customers as well if they got an any issues very difficult to get it fix or claim warranty unable to connect tv remote app on phone tv looks great sound quality is also good picture colours are good but it looks pixelated remote is responsive android os is responsive no lag it is not good enough for me considering there are other options

remote finally now facing issue with video display support team is not user friendly it s been two weeks i raised complaint no one is taking care my recommendation in we don t have to expect much but if it works for atleast months i would have recommend the product but i see the difficulty in nd week itself so save money and go for guarantee product instead of oneplus the picture quality is not up to the mark conpared to the other models of similar price the size of the tv is small poor sound quality tv picture quality is awesome but gotten defective display screen become white suddenly unable to give rating because it is defeated bad luck one of the worst product i have never seen we watch tv only days after that automatically switch off not powering on no proper service please don t buy the service is very very very worat worst from oneplus i gave complaint one month ago upto now i didn t get any response please don t buy oneplus products worst products the sound quality is not good not clear at all to understand a conversation while playing youtube or prime or any online site this unclear sound output becomes more difficult to understand the picture quality is superb for that price point i am giving stars only because everything is good except no data saver mode and doesn t even support when u trying to update from play store tv lags a lot of times not very fluid the sound from the inbulit speakers is very very avg tv is excellent when it comes to picture quality and sound but comes with few issues google assistant is not easily operational installation is said to be free including wall mount but the installation guy came and asked for rs for wall mount bracket so i didn t wall mount it good thingspicture quality one of the worst experience i got from this product no customer service to help the tv was lying for almost days because no one came to install and finally i had to return most irresponsible service from one plu one plus tv are really good value for money picture quality best but sound quality is cheap amazon delivery are awesome very punctual but their instillation service are very very bad they are no contact to me after delivery days so i m instolated it my own way after sales service is very bad if u buy it think twice about service one of the best product technology wise just go for it sounds perfect picture quality great remote is cute this is a smart android tv voice search is there youtube working great and d h cable quality depends what plan you opt hd or sd i have hd sd both hd work superb and sd work but due to sd it works accordingly final go for it awesome design but poor sound quality apps availablity is less lot of lag in transition between apps please try vu cenima tvvery disappointed at oneplus worst experience after buying this can t able to replace after days of usage there was a lone on the screen services at its worst feeling disappointed with this product bought n flash sale one mnth emi only paid bt issues cmng day by day the tv is dead within months of use motherboard is dead and it s been months we are following it up without any sucess in getting it repaired product is in warranty quality is not upto the mark picture quality is ok but sound is not good hope system issue will be resolved in next ota update from oneplus this is my st experience with one and i am impressed i have been using the tv from almost a monthno issue detected running perfectly fine picture quality is awesome sound is good smart features are as android tvs have just sometimes remote takes time to operate otherwise it s worth every penny and yes you have to be patience like very for the installation process after month i am still love to watch tv with oneplus y series earlier i wished to brought u series but u series wasn t available so i have brought y series but it is truly love in it yeah still some bugs are there but i am happy to ignore it my best experience is swich off the room lights and tv brightness or tv ground light works good and a glass of made my tv experience good item was defective and more about it was ridiculous experience with amazon without came to installation they changed it to service completed and when i raised query then service person came after so many calls so i suggest never buy it again from amazon the y series oneplus tv is the worst when it come to the performance sound system is poor for standard size hall it lags too much the input ports are not proper it doesn t recognise sometimes the input device picture quality is ok ok the device lags too much which makes the picturequality look bad the services of the oneplus tv is the worst one should not buy oneplus tv y series go for the trusted tv brands first of all thank you amazon and one plus really love it very good picture quality it s k not support but full hd p it s very clear to watch and voice recognition it s clear remote control it s awesome love its it s really budget prize worth to buy it inch one plus tv welcome to our family in one plus tv installation service was very delay but very good service thank you for installation service only one hdmi port is working and the other which is placed towards downside isnt working please sort these kind of issues before delivery itself i am managing with only one port i wanted to replace this tv but on my sister s word i refused please don t purchase one plus tv totally wastage of money no wearnty service available if you want warranty claim you will get misbehave from oneplus company please don t purchase i wearing you all the screen gets blurry after minutes the product is very good and picture quality is soo good and very easy to install by reading the manual and very nice one the media could not be loaded this product are bye less the month this is occuer to i need replacement or i will rise an complant in count defective product sent replacement denied worst experience edge broken piece received after weeks of order placement there in aux port for sound i m unable to connect this tv to home theatre optical option not working don t buy this tv even though the tv is a very good deal the service is pathetic amazon is just playing with us fromthe last months apparently the tv has some missing motherboard parts and the warranty claim people doesn t lift the call if you are looking to spend your money on a tv which should last long then this is definitely not it if you want a genuine review and if you are looking for sound quality then don t buy it and rather go for mi inch smart tv i has all the things i own one sound not goodthin screen goodpicture quality goodoverall star poor servicing fraud servicing company they never changed the faulty parts no one responds to call and email amazon customer service just replies in automated responses do not buy this product met my expectations ratings relative to the price segment good build quality beautiful display rich in colours fair sound quality smooth android experience we are used to bulky television sets when this set arrived and was unboxed it had an air of non seriousness it looks like a large touch screen mobile phone but once you switch it on it packs quite a punch in terms of the screen quality the remote is very user friendly i have an issue with the sound though it s not that great but for the money i paid for this product i can t expect everything to be perfect overall a decent product sound quality is poor i e below average picture quality is whitish little bit as mi tv more over amazon is giving worst service after having slot bookings service person will come and tell that it is not free of cost we need to pay for wall mount stand and that to mi wall mount or else he will regret to come then after calling to amazon call service center and none will give proper replay very poor service by amazon they will make us fools by taking complaint the product is worth of buying the price of the tv is comes around k comparing to the other brand one plus gives standard and quality product i am giving this review after one year the warranty period is over and still there is no problem with product amazon provided the installation on the same day of delivery i appreciate amazon for it never buy this tv i have bought with k after days tv display is not working i am behind service care to get repair this tv was delivered on th sept i have raised a complaint on rd october but still no action taken either from amazon or oneplus very bad decision made by me regretting tv is good i hated the surprise billing demanded on installation for items amounting rs this cud have been told to me properly rather than being a surprise item speaker quality is horrible since they have back speakers it should be kept in an open space and not in any kind of closed space or something that has back covered also this wasn t mentioned in the details which is a little disappointing resolution is okayish feels more of rather than recommended for watching regular movies and shows but not for gaming picture quality is too good also the gap btwn the display and the outer boundary is a little bit which looks awesome in full hd sound quality is avg i suggest add a sound bar of boat about posting and packaging i have no words just amazing the remote is inbuilt google voice assistant which helps too much overall awesome product worth it the tv is perfect in this price range video quality is very good you can play videos at p in full hd smart features are quite excellent one thing that you can see very less bezels and tv is so slim and attractive overall tv is excellent but oneplus should improve their speaker sound its not upto the expectation sound improvement should be their worst tv full of hang no proper streaming disgusting so please please i strongly recommend don t buy at all look for something else there is no wall stand you have to pay extra if you are installing an new app like airtel xtream or sony live it is not installing i am very frustated now feeling like waste of money now after days u can not return it back guaranty will not work in this installation issue i was wrong i trusted this chinese tvplease dont buy many things are poor or not user friendly feature eq screen mirroring wifi connectivity switching remote is working just like very slow or bad functionality etc just putting comments for other mango man to take right smart tv instead of this one plus led quality very poor and bottom beading not proper stick with tv screen so occure focusing issue we raise the complaint and prob attend by technician he told this is manufacturer defect comes with one plus led tv always in my home other led tv sony brawia in this sony tv beading proper fits with body technician told me not compare with sony one plus is a low brand i got delivered damage product and also found missing accessories in which no remote guide book and battery found even when i applied for return first person who came for pick mis behave with family and leave damage piece in my stairs then i complained again and another pick up guy came today and he took with him that damage piece worst experience low quality cheap build go for vu tv or mi tv for better experience connectivity is very poor not even usb port is connecting properly google voice assistant is not working dolby atmos poor cheappp worst display panel blindly purchased tv for the brand oneplus but totally disappointed not user friendly don t buy oneplus tv only op s smart phones are good not any other gadgets reviewing this product after using months performance is really very good it s elegant look and sleek design enahance the feel of viewing but os updates needs to be done which will enhance the quality and performance worth buying smart purchase from amazon happy with the one plusblutthooth feature can be improved the tv remote does not function fast it is slow to remote commands plus remote does not have a sleep function overall performance of the tv not very satisfactory it lags in between and when we play ps it hangs every seconds it goes off stating no signal and comes back even after software update not much happy overall felling bad that i went for this when i had better options very disappointed with the product remote is not getting paired at all i have tried other bluetooth device to pair but tv not showing anything i tried many times in different way also but it is same as before when i read the negative comments on the reviews i thought people are expecting k tv features in k budget tv so i thought it would be good for its price range but when the product got delivered i realised buying this tv is a mistake build quality worst you won t feel worth of the money you spent on the tv remote control is another disaster overall better to go for alternative after using it for a month i am writing this review the tv is working properly and its picture quality is great sound quality is great amazon tv installation service is very poor it s one star worthy i waited for days for the engineer to come and install but no one came to install the tv dont buy this product wost servicewhat can i do the line appears on the screen after days of purchase i placed a warranty issue and still it doesn t resolve after one month amazon cancelled the warranty claim don t buy on plus tv their service is poor and support from amazon is worst it s around months my problem is not resolved first of all its not a inch it s a cut sizenot working voice recognitionnot looking one plus brand it s defiantly china assemble item only one plus using namein my opinion one plus loose ur brand valueif i compare to realme and mione plus is less than other product the picture quality is so crisp i can actually feel it is like k though it s not completely k the sound is far better than most of the already popular brands the remote response is amazing total worth the hdmi while playing ps goes black and comes back again within secs this was the only problem otherwise a great product so far going to good after months of use initially i thought i did a mistake buying a tv for monitor use as the text s was not as sharp as in the monitor but later i figured out the option called pc mode which provides clear text like monitor thats a cool feature felt happy door delivery has not done i personally went amazon store and tv is ok but remote is not workingyour technician has tell that it will replace tommorow but till now i didn t received any call from amazon and brand companyplease help us to get the remote immediately after ending of the return period my tv has this straight black vertical line problem picture quality is amazing and overall worth the price remote initially lags but later on it works fine there was an issue with tv connecting to internet when complaint was raised with oneplus cx care no technician visited to rectify the issue after several followups tv wall mount was not given free with tv which costs extra for adjustable one writing review just after months screen flickering and green lining so sad with one plus i have been using its phone which works fantastic but will never recommend android tv within a week of installing the tv we started seeing picture issues when reported the technician said it was an issue related to the set top box so we got that changed as well still the issue didn t go away after a couple of months the tv started restarting on its own every minutes or so we did everything on the troubleshoot list nothing works worst purchase ever great product manufactured by oneplus great deal given by amazon hassel free exchange by amazon everything is good wonderful display but remember it s full hd display if you come closer you can find noticesound is good when you change settings into dolb digital but iam getting crackling sound from left speaker i booked service if they solve the problem no problem otherwise i will go for replacementconnectivity also good only you feel laging when you do screen mirroring through wifi the media could not be loaded i can see white bulb inside and display look dusty patches inside the display maybe used piece or something faulty inside cant play k video with youtube this one average tv not happy with one plus product the media could not be loaded has power button problem with in month when switching on in the remote it is not switching on after several attempts it is switching on the picture and sound quality is very very good and you can literally purchase it if you look something in this budget than any other brand works with oneplus connect response speed is also great however you may face some problem with chromecast but overall it is literally worth buying never buy this tv from amazon buy it from oneplus because after delivery they don t care about your installation it s been a week my tv is just laying around and the installation is being reschedule on its own times not a single call from the technician and if you open the box your warranty is gone so never buy it from amazon they don t even care about the installation the tv is awesome buy for a budget smart tv lives up to the reputation of one products sound output is not that excellent but overall a good product for it s price segment it s definitely good option for a bedroom tv it s a ideal inch is good for viewing distance of ft if your distance is more than ft then please prefer a inch tv customer care can not be easily accessed and then no turn around time guidelines please do not buy no repair available for days now really oneplus usb drive not working properly in tv fat nit support what to do its bug and can fix by simple update but still not happen poor service its a budget tv but dont expect it be sony first sony is priced very high and it delivers according to it to be honest i feel for this price range this is the best television packed with all features and also its one plus tv so had a better goodwil than other tv s in this range this tv is the worst product in my i have ever bought after days of purchase it started malfunctioning and one plus dont any solution even after months as they said that they have parts don t purchase it as one plus not able to give service and i recommend to amazon to remove this company from your portal tv build quality is very goood bt when come to its display part so much white and black spot found tv s sound quality is really good and loud company like one plus this type of issus is not expected i request amazon to replace my tv and they accept that tv have some problem on its display so they replace it asap the media could not be loaded waste of money i purchase it on last august now disply of my tv not showing anything without any reason i just update system n then disply gone wrong so according to me instead of oneplus u can for samsung or sony or else yes they r more costly then oneplus but they r value for money totally waste from day one itself tv getting hanged and more over remote not responding while power on volume will too noisy when we increase only good thing picture quality is good don t plan to buy this tv satisfy with this product picture quality is superb dolby sound of this tv is amazing voice recognition is very easy to use and very smart too bluetooth remote of this tv is goodoverall very good product must buy waste many complainants automatically switching off go with mi tv it s good the worsted tv i ve seen i made many complainants in oneplus customer care but they never responded and failed to send the technician even the technician dont have awareness about the tv and it s program he s just a hardware installer that s all he don t have the quality to treat the problem good android tv in the price range with decent picture quality and good sound quality impressed with the installation service by vecare the walmount was not a part of the package however got it for free as a part of the free installation the serviceman were v polite and professional amazon like flipkart should work on better extended warranty deals the flipkart one is quite a deal at for extra years after using this product for a week suddenly during usage of the tv there were lines all over the screen trying reaching amazon customer care and product provider from last one week but no one taking the responsibility of the product defect and i am not even contacted by the supplier this issue is been occurring after days so customer care is just saying that we can not return the product what should i do kindly guide good product one can purchase without much doubts volume and picture quality is good body quality remote is good with smart features buyers should avoid getting waylaid by negative reviews value for money light weight thin panel stand looks delicate for table top display if kids and pets around better to install on wall to avoid accidents overall satisfied is this a fake not a dolby atmos speaker voice quality is not clearity at high end volume and remote is too much laggy too much slow work on tv and tv is also laggy after back on any app and u want to go home screen is time to take also second badi badi baatey or vadapaun khate is that true dilounge for oneplus and another problem amazon installation service is provided me wall mount stand of mi brand not oneplus brand the tv is very good to have as a secondary tv the sound is great and the remaining qualities are simply superb the picture quality is really good for a inch tv and the bezel free design gives it a great look once the remote is connected there is no problem with the voice recognition or the controlling overall a great product for very less price must buy not value for money tv is not at par in comparison to other brands even in the mid segment poor picture quality and depth in color low grade android app is pathetic not a real product of one plus in comparison to the mobile experience i had huge expectations with this one plus y series tv but it turned out to be a huge disappointment for me the screen was having black patches bezels are very thin sound quality is okaypicture quality is awesomevoice recognition is delay for sec but it is okay at this price rangeand the remote control is very handy the media could not be loaded bad experience bad product bad service repair service too late no positive response from amazon and oneplusworst tv ever don t buygoogle assistant not working complaint times no solution my one plus inch tv not running properly today service man also visited and tell now your tv is updated at that time tv run on wifi but now it is wifi is turning on off automatically and not connecting installation services is to bad he was not fixing your septop and also i was requesting him sir plz can u fixed the septop boxx and also informing us about products operating details but he straightly telling no i am here for open and fix the but he is misser and also tv speed is too much slow but viewing quality is amazing and etc thing s is also good but installation services is useless the media could not be loaded bought a wall mount bracket it was movable and great by the installation person very much kind of him even though bracket has to be wall mounted drilling on wall there wasn t even a dust on the floor installer was using the drilling machine with dust collector it s a good product by oneplus but the main problem was the tv installation because of the pandemic it s too late for installation of tv so it s better to buy offline rather than buing online picture quality is good sound quality is ok smart function not so good very slow time consuming software getting time to open the apps overall rating is value for money i had purchased android tv from amazon after month used android tv was blank screen i called the oneplus customer care but i didn t get any response so i request all oneplus customers don t purchase any android tv from oneplus i didn t get any calls i had lost my money also thankyou just got the tv delivered a great product in inch segment from the brand sound quality is good picture quality is superb as well remote is very smooth easy to set up by self build quality is also very good worth buying it as a entry level product the only flaw i had witnessed is only hdmi port support audio output pathetic picture quality its essentially an lcd selling as led an poor response from amazon buy some other brands and not from amazon since they re irresponsible stands are bit loose if u make your tv stand on legs on a table u feel so scared because the even after tighten up the screws well still they are moving and sound quality need to be improved the dolby punch is missing i like the tv pretty much the picture and sound quality is the best valued at this price segment but the only problem with the tv is depicted in the second pic i posted i don t understand why it s happening when i change the channel for two seconds then it comes to normal very disappointing with this new product of one plus because screen not appear issue found within months of purchase and the service is poor service center not available at nearby guys do not waist ur money to buy this buy samsung sony tv we are not getting service nor replace the products by amazon or one plus company i am worried about this product because it s no perform properly i have to start it through push button on tv can t start it by remote controls i want replacement of this product the media could not be loaded i got worest tv one plus y i bought this tv months back now the display of the tv is shown in the above video no quick service also no one can t respond properly there s no immediate service sent a defective product remote is not working when installing time technician found it no replacement confirmation from oneplus amazon said we can t do replacement its done only by manufacturer better option is canc the product and take refund than purchage other brand waste of time and affords the media could not be loaded tv getting freeze every one or two days you can t do anything with tv you just need to unplug the power from electricity this not end also you will not get any support for this issue i went all social media sites twitter facebook customer care still no solution with tv the sound quality is not at all good anyone trying to purchase please go for a better brand not oneplus recently i put a new pendrive it asked me format after format the pendrive got corrupted this tv not support alexa amazon cheated me with fake advertising poor picture quality in normal cable connection in hd it s ok poor sound quality must have sound bar overall ok amazon customer care is good but i didn t get installation from the company i done from a local repair guy so plz confirm it before buy good product i have and size wise decent sound quality also good if you compare with money google assistance is greate picture quality also decent not as sony but in this price range it s satisfactory for me i bought it last month if it will work yrs or more than that then it s paysa wasul please don t buy this productno customer support if you face any issuesi have faced technical issue no proper response from support team becareful before buying amazon delivery is excellent but the installation service is worst one plus tv at this price of is really worth reliance digital service is good and faster than amazon and the service from reliance digital is excellent i was hoping someone will turn up for demonstration as i am facing difficulty in downloading new apps but no one came for demonstration although the installation was tedious and we had to call external help other than that it is a good product the media could not be loaded we purchased this one plus tv twice one of the remote stopped working and no support provided by amazon and one plus tv is useless without remote no physical button in tv is given and no replacement of remote available in market good product picture quality is good surround sound works well fairly responsive ui expected awesome picture quality and premium ui quality and response but it s not there so didn t feel like a one plus brand tv ui clarity is very bad feel like it is pixelated but video picture quality is good the tv stopped working in less than a year nyc product i have been using one plus for last yrs and i m very satisfied with the quality that one plus offers and this smart tv form one plus is also good good product in this segment but sound quality is average oneplus should improve sound quality and remote response is also littile bit slow and it s wifi connectivity only support ghz oneplus should work on these cons i like its best feature is one plus connect app it is connect phone to tv to use phone like remote and screencast etc i bought my tv on st march and installed on rd march and i experience with too good quality but it become zero brightness on march i raised a complaint and verified by technician and i placed a replacement now i received a new product on th march and i m waiting for installation i m hoping for this will be good than my old product screen flickering started immediately after installation installation also not went smoothly no proper supportno priority to customers received the defective productasked the amazon executive to replace the product but they he said it is only possible after the technician visit but technician cancled my appointment without informing me later i received sms to reschedule the technician visit i don t understand whats happening with the amazon please dont buy these product one of the worst product from the oneplus bought this on aug and in less than a year the picture went off had to get it repaired twice after the warrenty it happened in th month again and having to pay out of pocket the tv has great picture quality and it is very hard and tasking to pair the remote control to the tv but for sound quality you will need speakers with a sub woofer as the tv sounds like old toshiba laptops arguing over who gets to charge first ram is too less picture quality is poor only offers pxslow processorwhen done screen cast there is a lag between both the screens phone and tv which is again a problemdo not purchase this tv because you can have other brand tv in market in same price with better configuration one plus tv and features are good but as amazon showing combo with alexa it s not pairing and there is people who wrote about this on oneplus site although cutomer care telling to contact oneplus although amazon is promoting as combo could not have asked for more in this price the tv is perfect just as one would expect from a oneplus device but it is better to get a soundbar with it for amazing sound poor software optimization the tv works fine however while watching netflix the tv will automatically change to oxygen play screen i have reset the tv hope that fixes the issue very nice tv in this price range from one plus picture quality is superb sound quality is ok ok but better than mi tv sbuilt quality is also goodtv looks premium because of bezel less design remote controller is also made of good quality plastic and it is very good looking no wall mounted stand or at least screws for stand not providedunsatisfied with thisuntil than tv is very good dont buy seriously telling you guys instead buy mi or vu tv too many bugs in one plus tv netflux and chromecast not working properly quality is good butit lags while on and offscreen mirroring is not possible with vivo phonesit only works when external speakers has the hdmi supportchrome casting has issue even when i disconnect the youtube or wynk it keeps playing on the tv screenhoping that oneplus will have the ota updates very soon to fix these issues after sale service was worst don t buy this product repair parts are not available and for any service you have to take many follow up go for mi led tv much better than this one from months continuously taking follow ups of the service team for the wifi connection issue every time i getting different reason worst product worst service not to suggest to buy this product the product is not at all good aa compared to the competitors i bought a inch smart tv for which there waa no installation done the tv is giving electric shock if u touch it the remote that came with it is not working nd i cant get in touch with anyone picture quality is good and sound quality is very poor remote control is very slow in connecting the tv doesn t work half the time the app s don t open the tv has become extremely slow in months of purchase it takes mins to increase or decrease the volume netflix prime have stopped working logged several complains on amazon but there is no return or refund or even someone to repair this software problem laggy poor remote connectivity chrome cast is vest dont think for chrome in this device screen will stuckdisplay quality is not good picture look like fadedover not a good experiencei like sound bezel only in this tv other then no use of this tv purchased the oneplus tv with great expectations it turns out to be a great mistake of a decision as from day one the tv behaved as a defective product upon lodging repeated complaints the technicians upon attending the tv inform me that the mother board is defective i still await resolution of the complaints this one plus led tv gets hanged every time its not worth bying it sound is also not audible please go for mi led tv instead as i am using mi oed tv a pro too since last years but purchased one plus tv just days ago and hanging problem is since then only the media could not be loaded i want to sey that nobody purchase oneplus tv i make mistake to purchase oneplus tv now amazon and oneplus both refused to installation how can you expect about services i purchased prime membership also infuture drop prime membership also thanks amazon and oneplus not a good android tv the software is buggy even after a year and the hardware is poor i have never successfully turned it on opened an app and closed without an issue it also lack apple tv the media could not be loaded pen drive does not connect screen cast is not working well overall experience is so much bad that i can t compare with local chinese tv because local chinese tv is also much better than oneplus inches tv speaker is average picture quality below average after months usage this is the condition screen completely white colours are not proper times complaint but not a single call received in warranty currently after one week of purchase lines on screen with picture enlarged service man came and told it s software problem and rectified but the problem repeated again in one week service man told that the display should be changed so booked again for service no responce till ten days very bad service and waste to buy this picture quality is good features is fine sound is not much expected no wall clamps do not dependent installation on vecare better install ourself they charged for installation product overall outlook is good the media could not be loaded amazon thanxs your delivery before expected time and my led is very good condition amazon is first choice always for online shopping my led tv is very good sound quality are best whenever i try to enter the wifi password i am not able to enter it and i am not

showroom i expected more out of one plus this tv is so laggy that it makes the whole tv watching experience a pain i have picture quality and the features are good but the slowness shadows is all picture quality and sound are good software has following bugsif you close the tv directly from the switch date got reset and after that wifi doesn t get connected unable to do screen castunable to

automatic restart happen within days complain and replace the tc again after month same problem has been occur one of the worst customer support picture and sound quality not as expected as one plus installation person didn t show up so i had to do it myself and had to buy other accessories too before buying it i saw one of the review of display lining after days but i ignored it purchase it but just after one month it shows it s me same problem that i saw in review or more worseplzz buy with care as i got this default one now i can t replace so i claim for warranty now what happens next wait and watchreally frustrated from such branded tv if you want a low budget television then you must go for it along with it it has some best features available in this budget so i would say you should go for it without was thinking about any other tv because of warranty gets you of one plus is much much better than the any other television brand you get purchashed this as i liked the oneplus phone and it turns out to be good for the current price range the dolby voice is really good the picture quality seems goood too would definately recommend but it wont compete with samsung sony quality of tv s it s been a month we are using one plus smart tv tv smart features are good but the smart tv specially youtube gets hang alot i have to switch off directly from main connection also i tried using pen drive to watch movies but my pen drive did not worked after plugged into my smart tv till now it is working fine never go for it i was a oneplus fan and i am totally disappointed the tv display panel has some issues within one month of purcahse it has a red tint kind of thing on the screen i waited for a long time to buy the tv from oneplus and this is i get bluetooth headset version not working in this tv sound came improper struck then one mirror casting getting very delay in one plus connect to second delayed this only problem in my tv then finally one plus technical support teamsolve that problem now working good thanks to oneplus tv is awsm sound quality for a single room is satisfied but for hall u should go for u series the only problem is that remote is completely black along with buttons so maximum of time you have to look the button and than press otherwise wrong key get s pressed minor one but i suggest remote button should be little more gripable rather than being flat with the surface sound quality fluctuates and not upto the mark but display quality is good for the budget just buy it incredible price after card discount also get one plus is better than other mid brand looks good easy to operate good picture qualityhas good value for money features and picture qualitybut issue with voice recognition misses initial words most of the time and takes time to recognise words facing remote connectivity issue as well as automatically it going to open netflix or prime while watching tv sound quality need to improve screen quality was awesome

facing with non hd channelsthe picture quality is bad and shows lots of pixels the voice of the tv is not good it takes time and when the tv starts the screen will go blank after or minutes for sec to sec the product is not upto mark i have purchased so i can t do anything but will suggest to not buy this tv better to go with some other brand delivered on time installation was done as per the committed date tv working satisfactorily for last weeks panel of this tv stop working after some day of purchase we have submit the request for service under warranty but till date service not done worst service worst tv don t buy this tv the tv was delivered on time but installation took more than hrs which was hrs beyond the schedule i saw while placing the order i felt it would have been better if there is some coordination between seller and installation team so that i could have contacted technician directly after delivery of tv but it did not materialize nice color great viewing experience great user interface loved it i am big time oneplus user the quality of the product and at the price what s they are offering is making the deal so awesome i got defective tv unable to connect the wifi and have some remote pairings issue writing this review after almost of using one plus tv delivery as expected the technician called and gave us the estimated time of delivery good picture quality and sound quality good product for k price range easy to use easy to install other apps like voot and tvf recommended to buy this oneplus tv is very good picture quality and sound quality and all other apps like youtube work perfectly and oneplus connect feature is awsume oneplus has come up with this smart tv as very low cost and as per the picture sound quality it is amazing only drawback i found in it is that there is no option available to set picture or sound quality it will be default and depend upon your connection due to this you get sharp colors and the base of sound is also very low cancelled another brands order to get this a little disappointing when it keeps hanging every once in a while picture quality and user interface is great though except picture quality nothing is good remote response painfully slow voice feature not working dumb tele customer support mi farway better than picture quality is best but sound and remote control is not at all good the tv is strucking and not working smoothly and it s not connect not controlled by alexa echo dot worst product too much lags no clear volume it cannot be returned and even wall mount stand have charges what the benift of service then donot buy for brand go to another i can now only regret amazon even don t return and exchange they want themself to see lag it this covid situation even you cannyopen box without techniqation as then warranty will be gone one plus has the worst customer service my tv is in repair since a month and they aren t responding product delivered on time but the

particular with hd channels wow superb remote works after few seconds but it is ok and upcourse sound quality i made a request for oneplus team please improve the sound quality if u made sound as perfect then this oneplus tv is ok thank u oneplus just keeep in mind the price don t expect seemless experience but according to the rates its gr you get every feature use a sound bar for bettoer sound experience brought tv on th of nov calling for service to amazon from th dec but no one trun up for service der are black circle appearing on tv from th dec dey are also not replacing it what u do i don t know before purchase heard online negitive reviews after after buying this tv i must say i made a perfect decision buying this product picture sound quality awesome initially i thought i

work and i have to switch off from plug and replug then it s start working when we press any key from remote it takes few seconds to capture display is decent though you had experience of kdesign is good but sound quality is worst looks like your listening to a china model phone with no clarityhence would suggest to buy bluetooth speaker or home theatre or a good sound bar too late delivery even for prime customer it took days to get in home tv material quality was too bad and manufacturing defect in top left corner at frame disapointed with product quality and delivery picture quality was good sound quality was average if your looking for a tv around k consider mi k tv and decide the media could not be loaded installation done finally i m happy now it s nice tv product is good sound

features work well for reading a pendrive one must use the media app tv lags alot action performed on pressing a key from oneplus bluetooth remote takes much time also the sound gets distorted after few min of viewing and after increasing vol by after months speaker not worked then service engineer opened and checked the connection of the speaker there is wire damage due that speakt was not worked they fixed the stand speaker and after days new speaker replaced now working fine if i could find the negative marking i will definitely give negative marking to this product its worst product please don t waste your money its worhtlessssss heard a lot of positive and negative reviews about the product before buying but my experience with this tv has been great haven t faced any glitches as of yes at this price range the sound and display quality is amazing too totally worth the price the smart tv everyone should have in thier houses this product is easy to use has good sound system even the services for the product is good tv is bit slow compared to other brands with the same ram android within days after purchase it stoped working very pathetic customer service it s been more than days since i registered the complaint but no one visited till now for servicing will not suggest to buy it s completely waste of time talking to customer care value for money product picture quality is good pair it with alexa and control the tv with voice command excellent support from amazon as tv got installed within mins of delivery completely satisfied with the purchase i like ths picture quality and bezel less display a lot dolby digital sound works great you don t need to go beyond volume in a medium room because it s loud enough remote control has a minimalist design so easy to use works great on wifi the installation service was horrible the workers were extremely rude and even charged an additional uncalled for sum of rs for screws plus the remote and tv are not in full sync it s a bit slow bad experience inch tv no wall mount included table stand installation and demo given politely by the service guy but the wall mount price he said was while its in invoice and amazon site too expensive days usage review high contrast low volume bgm high but voice is little low product quality and other features are good till now very tough interface and no app gets downloaded apart from the ones already therehave called for technician times no one comesworst after sale service overall system of the tv is functioning very slowapplications get hung as well picture quality hd

experience and damage eyes it s sound quality isn t as good as vu cinema tv but it s okay at this price point if you really want to enjoy a good picture quality then go for it worst experience with one plus inches tv never go with one plus inch variant major issues with red blue green vibrancy worst voice recognition feature don t buy one plus inches tv initiated for refund and refund and return done thanks to amazon india good tv at this price segment first thank you amazon for one day delivery display is very good cinematic experience performance is very good and smooth due to processor bezel are excellent sound much not good but better for small room overall it is a good tv at this price segment you can go for it the tv is also goodno installation issuebuild quality sounds quality resolution and color temperature most affordable of middle and lower class family considering price it was good at display but audio quality was not up to the mark remaining all the best the thing is the sound quality in the price along with the features available please do not buy very poor customer service my tv is not working properly for last months and the issue is not resolved till date giving one star because tv having bluetooth connection issues every time we have to pair bluetooth device to use and after connecting to bluetooth broken sounds is coming the picture quality and view angle is very poor in degree angle the display looks like a one big white patch not expected this from one best product app response is good and picture clarity is awesome sound quality is also better in comparison to other smart led tvs the product is really amazing the picture clarity and sound is really good the design looks cool the interface is very smooth and user friendly over all best tv for k very poor quality worth rs only go for the expensive model with in months u will get issuues wifi won t connect poor customer support from oneplus they doesn t give a damn strong ly recommend not to buy worst product display got damaged after use of months till now they cant repair it corectly dont buy tjis product no proper service centres the media could not be loaded from starting very bad sound quality sometimes sound goes when we start the led and service team is doing experiment on this from starting and now i am not going to buy any product from amazon because they are not going to solve the problem the sound is good and the picture not as per our expectation tv getting auto restartnot suitable for family room tv the media could not be loaded worst display even i completed to the team not response well very bad service quality product tv in one plus waste of money even amazon also don t worry after sell the product very i m very bad about this excellent display the sound quality could be better though initially the tv lagged a lot while setting up netflix and youtube after a few hours it is now working fine though it does lag a bit sometimes possibly due to a slow processor received defective item for visit technician showing that slots are not available for contact option not working great smart features very good picture quality and good voice recognition overall a good product the product is not good cheating in amazon there is not any response from amazon and one plus company i will go to consumer court i am very happy and satisfy customer must buy this tv picture quality and sound are very good the product won t last for more than months my display is gone they replaced it now my audio is not clear the screen fluctuates lots of flaws and the worst part is their service is very poor the tv probably gives you the best display in this price range trust me being a graphics designer i know how colour matters in a tv and this produces one of the best yes resolution will be a problem for people but at k you are getting your best everything is ok as per price and moreover compare b w realme tv and one plus the experience was superb at one plus tv in both tv sound quality was a minor difference as quality of picture oneplus is good from my experience the media could not be loaded bought this tv months before after days the display stopped working and only audio is playing raised the complaint days before but since last days request was on hold and waiting for the tv part oneplus tv is not up to the marknot even single day from the date of purchase the display shown half of the screen with stripesfelt very bad about the productas well as the quality of display is not so good picture quality is very poor not able to set proper color settings the media could not be loaded exactly after days screen damaged even service also after complaint nonone resopond from last one wee still waiting plz don t buy the media could

t respond to remote most of the time connectivity hdmi bluetooth screen casting nothing is working properly customer service worst device poor quality doesn t work properly no bluetooth option to connect wireless display hdmi doesn t detect within a month from purchase there was a problem with wifi device i have called up the costumer care an engineer told me to repair the part with in days but even after a week no one has turned up i am still expecting to get this repaired good product but picture quality should be more as oneplus is new in competetion if you want to spend a few more bucks go for lg sound quality bis not good comparing with same segment led w sound is a joke android interface is responsive tv has very good picture quality in built sound quality is great plethora or customisations available to improve picture movie quality according to you will worst product ever it s just been a month since i got this tv and it always lags and it s very irresponsive all the built in apps keep crashing frequently tv keeps lagging while switching between apps if i could i would like to return this tv and get refund lagging in software lagging remote sound clumsy when power off on tv is taking too much time to start navigation is easy and smooth sofware should be updated fix all bugs remote is laggy some times not working unexpectedly jumping from tv to main menu it s okay performance is not very great it take timeto start response sec late response i don t know if it s just mine hate it cz doesn t support win tv performance is very slow takes very long time to show home page system lag is too much during navigation didn t expect such a bad product from one plus rd class support the tv is not vaild for money and the support team is not proper and not experinced they say in the name of repair and crack the panel be aware technical team is no valid for nothing it s been a month till now they didn t replace my tv excellent in this price range and spl screen resolution and clarity also it s refresh rate is good and sound quality is fine don t buy this very poor service from the brand and amazon this remote doesn t work and it s been over a week of follow ups with amazon but no technician had visited so far they keep rescheduling on their own until the days replacement window closes pathetic service the tv got busted after working for few months the worst thing is that their customer service is also worst the provider just cut my call when i was talking about the replacement with that guy i need this to be replaced asap the media could not be loaded very good product oneplus tv outstanding inch smart tv with youtube netflix amazon prime video built in if your budget is below k then you should consider this it has chromecast and oneplus connect to cast mobile screen oneplus connect app can also be used as its remote its speakers are just awesome very very worste service we brought tv on januaryafter one month tv not getting switching onand we give a compliment march itself still my tv not rectified almost month my tv simply gept it my room that service provider nor responsible properly screen issues worst tv don t buy it s bad experience with amazon i bought oneplus inch tv it was not working for last month complaint raised but no response very worst service very worst product all the popular ott platforms are at the finger tips the video quality is good provided we take an hd dth connection the only drawback is its speaker quality they sound like songs and movies from a tumbler if they improve that the tv will be good i can not connect my mobile to this tv without chromecast and internet conncetion i saw some lg tvs shows its name in our wifi search and we can connect by touching that name that to when i was in offline so simple right my setup box and hdmi interface has to be conn cted every time i use it the audio is not working if don t do this step customer care sucks the media could not be loaded i am so diassponted with the tv firstly i thought one plus would be good brand so purchased it now after one month tv colour is getting faded i have uploaded the video please don t buy this product picture quality is nice average performance considering the brand and price os is not upto the mark sometime os stop responding and have to restart the tv very nice picture quality and fast reboot system and time to time update you can get no bugs problem and sound quality is good you can easily rear if your volume is less than bluetooth connectivity are too good writing this review after weeks of usage i am extremely disappointed with this product from one plus one of the poorest picture and ok ok types sound quality i would never recommend anyone to buy it it has also started showing problems like the second hdmi port is not working properly thus resulting in poor and distorted colors tv is of good quality and worth the money there is a lot of lag for the response from remote there is lot of lag i like picture quality that is fabulous but the problem is remote command that take to sec to respond sometimes it hangs i expect one plus solve this issue with new update and u can t use google chrome u have to use firefox but m using puffin tv browser that is also good rest is fine its a ok ok tv gb ram is too low and frequent freezing happens while switching between apps mostly noticed while watching youtube sound is below average at this price point you cannot complain excellent craft and finish audio video quality is great compared to mi tv best tv in the television hanging alot and sound quality is also very poor ar this price range it is very good u can t compare this with sony but ys all over good product bad sound qualitypicture quality is goodon off button prblmlaggy ui product is very nice however installation service is pathetic even after three days of delivery no one turned up for tv installation raised a complaint at customer care but to no avail dont buy any one plus product after sales service is zero its more than a year of continuous calling to one plus but no response from any customer service executive mi is better than one plus worst it stopped working after a week nice television in this budget i am happy about the features and the look the television give me to my living room the media could not be loaded display worst quality and my display had problem months back still are saying display out of stock service also very worst better to buy samsung or vu or lg etc another brand don t buy oneplus tv this is a nice tv but don t expect much from this tv not the software quality expected from onepluspros good picture quality good sound quality sleek designcons bugged software not responsive sticks a lot bad ui experience weak processor compared to other tv it has been more then months but yes the product is good but some time the response time of switching applications take a bit more time turning on your tv through remote some time becomes pain full as the response time is slow perfect bedroom television for medium size rooms should bundle wall mount as well because the installation agent used a local mount and it doesn t look good as it s a very thin tv sort of picture frame voice and picture quality is nice also voice recognition works like a charm i was a bit sceptical to go with plus since in previous reviews sound quality was rated low i went with plus anyways and i am extremely satisfied sound quality is good and u have tolhe ability to modify it as well the tv if defective and it has been reported on the amazon portal but nothing has been done even after days after the complaint was registered need to fix sound quality remote lag screen on time need to reduce screen mirroring need to be enhanced tv lags or hang during switching over appsoverall value for money very worst instalment days left iam purchasing product tilldate istall not done service engineers also worst talking just minit i will be there but days left where is the your service engineer when did install the product waiting for u perfect budget tv with a good brand loaded with lots of features plastic is very cheap broken while tightening the screws it s the worst tv just for months it s display gone its an problematic smart tv with lags n hdmi port problems and from a month i am asking for the oneplus team to support but no one is interested tooo much faltu tv don t buy the chromecast has its own attitude doesn t work when you want it to the system needs to be restarted all the time the picture automatically starts blinking and goes multicoloured and pixelated not something expected from oneplus great quality video didn t find any issues with audio either wish it had wall mount included the media could not be loaded this one plus tv purchased before months ago after that i am facing a problem now showing me some black spots on display in diffrent place while i am watching it others features are good quality but build display quality is not satisfied lags too much you have try atleast times to get it on picture quality is moderate but sound quality is poor after wall mounting it seems i made huge mistake buy picking this up by the brand name and slightly cheaper price great tv at this price picture and sound quality both are awesome the wifi capacity and range is also very strong no need to think twice before buying this tv fulfilled all the expectations i had with oneplus smart features are good but when connected to stb through hdmi brightness is automatically getting reduced resulting in worse picture quality when tried stb through hdmi along with this brightness issue audio is not coming through at all when we try to verify the device through oneplus in by entering serial number it will show invalid device code also not able to connect alexa to tv don t trust amazon one plus tv is good the media could not be loaded this is by and far the best buy for the pricetag remote and tv is simple to setup an update might be needed on first boot sound isn t the best especially if the room is bigger and unit isn t mounted there are no response from customer service and customer service very poor they not answer my complaint to display not working from purchas great picture quality when you watch netflix and amazon prime youtube playback also is great tv speakers are average and can be improved airpods and other bluetooth headphones can be connected bezel less display as mentioned feels wonderful overall worth the price from oneplus it is just days before this one plus inches tv delivered to me and you can see the image which i attached the tv screen is not working it looks like again the proved that we should not buy any product from any chines company this is the quality of product of giving by one plus now days such a worth less product display have problem some led lights not work its showing black dot lot several places its really disappointed for me i purchased with emi its was still going but tv shows like this what can i do for this problem the media could not be loaded quite good tv but not impressed with the sound quality at all need to purchase soundbar now oneplus connect is useful and unique thing which you will not see in any other televisions everything is better like picture quality sound quality and it s smart featuresmost important thing is that u can get one plus brand logo in this price my tv just one month old and one part is missing blutooth not working everytime showing retrieving data don t purchase electronics items from online local shops are better option the media could not be loaded the picture quality goes bad at any point of time it ends up hanging everytime and then i have to restart it everytime not knowing how many minutes it will work well further even after getting a replacement the issue still exists want to return the product as soon as possible the picture quality is awesome and it s value for money to buy oneplus tv in this price range no one can expect this type of picture quality and features one think i like to share with you guys that the it comes with bezel less display best product but ram is gb so some time it hang or it take time to load any application the tv is great but lags when it starts and the service of amazon is pathetic as no one has shown for installation till now as it has been days i have purchased this tv and always i have to reschedule for next day as they are not showing up at all worst service by amazon team got a damaged product and regretting now almost everyone is getting damaged piece pixels are dead from top right the product was delivered in time installation done but the television demonstration not done please depute your person to give a demo of the product you can inform the company i e oneplus to give the demo else we will find it difficult to operate properly all the features available bad repair service of onplus

tv is too laggy doesn t connect to internet switches off automatically while playing something the media could not be loaded best android tv not a hd tvpoor sound qualitypoor picture qualitywe recommend lg sony samsung everything thing is good except the installation and customer service the customer service is very poor forget about the complaint you raised you have to raised the same complaints multiple times screen minoring sometimes doesn t work properly and voice recognition is bit poor the smart features and pictures quality are very nice and the screen is best choice for bedroom or small size livingroom tv border is not protected hence need to use gently since launch of oneplus y it s promos promised an echo dot speaker at no extra cost i pre booked and waited for days to get one in flash sale but just before flash sale on prime day sale you removed the offer without any prior notice i realised it after making payment felt really bad not too good product my tv is hanging alexa not connecting few time blutooth connectivity with sound system create mess non recommend tv the media could not be loaded good product but wall hanging not ni box oneplus charge extra payment for this overall tv is okay picture quality is good voice quality is not upto the mark voice is not very clear no one has come for installation change command takes time it s not that quick the product was delivered as promised within hours installation and demo was done by the same team which delivered the tv so everything was smooth and hassle free from beginning to end performance of the tv is good too early to comment about the reliability though its been over a week and tv is working fine with apps and ui is also good we can even run tv wifi with mob hotspot its worthy not to bay because tv was automatically stop running service provider was not provide service till now again today on dated technician not visit my home till pm poor qualitydisplay got blank

service worst product and also worst service ever it s been month and i didn t get my tv repaired don t buy this product picture is good and voice recognition and volume control and sound quality is good picture quality is good but sound quality is very bad did not expected this from one plus but picture quality is worth the view free installation is done wall mount is free ask delivery person if needed it s free of cost on time delivery and installation the display quality is very good at lower price sound quality is also good wall mount is not available with the tv we need to pay extra for the wall mounting i prefer to buy the wall mount stand along with the tv while online purchase itself display has bright spots which makes oneplus tv settled i purchased by seeing best seller and brand but bad experience i got with connectivity and oneplus connect app installation service also worst just he make tv on and went google voice search also not working my suggestion is better to go for sony samsung or lg sound is like rs sound box which is far better than this designers please look in to this sound quality i got many features which oneplus is offering at very affordable price with good quality and its sound system is very good so you don t need any speakers or hometheatre such a bad product within months the screen display got bad and vertical lines appeared on the screen it s a waste of money and even the amazon warranty is of no use we can t even book for service request still though it in warranty period value for moneysimply loved itbest in its range worst product with in one day display problem cmg only auido cmg bad quality product and bad customer service no exchange available for exchange they asking days time for technician enquiry give certificate that tv not working really bad experience with amazon please don t buy this product waste of money not satisfied with this product it s not working properly pendrive jack is not working lagging too much smart

repair technicians are not trained properly picture quality is good not best tv was lagging before last update but now its fine but not properly fixed amazon echo dot not following commands tried many methods from many sources but still no success audio quality is good picture quality is very bad it does not have clarity i think in this segment this model tops the chart with all the aspects lets see how it plays in long run will keep you posted picture quality is pathetic not in line with what they have claimed better to go with samsung if you have more rupees to spend smart features are good everything is really great but if it were had k support would have been perfect the support from amazon works really well we have a exchange so all support was fantastic tv itself is really good all smart features in the tv we are using for months now i can say we love this buy nice product with so many smart features good and decent picture and sound quality only denerit is the tv remote and it hangs like android mobile set but best product in this price range voice recognition option gone in a week and google assistance not working need special app for screen mirror option some mobiles not mirror wit it nice tv slim and clear software needs to updated they have some errors and i am hoping for update to come not worth for money lags a lot and display is average better to go for other brands installation not done by the team raised concerns with amazon multiple times but no response finally did through local service guy for product is good instalation on time better than vu cinema picture quality sound quality is bad than vu cenima so friends you want best picture go for oneplus or for sound quality go with vu cinema the tv has some bugs like android mobiles have like hanging

s almost two since it s installed even the sound is not clear we sent back the product just after unboxing it amazon prime was just not logging in after repeatedly trying by us and installation person we could not crack it so we decided it to just return it we bought it with great expectation and turned out to be a bad decision tv is very good but the installation service is worst after two months the free installation service have not materialised so i have installed it myself without caring about warranty hanging and restart issue oneplus phone is good but tv is very poor quality not expected from one plus why extra charged for stand stand does not come with tv product is ok with its pricing but services rendered by amazon is absolutely poor don t purchase anything during sale bcz they don

in bluetooth while connecting a bluetooth device the audio has a latency bought on th dec problem with display in less than a month ordered for service check scheduled on jan i am really afraid that oneplus is selling a tv unit without a wallmount bracket and the worse thing is if buy a bracket from outside it will not fit into the tv jack in this case it is a must that oneplus should include a wallmount bracket in the total package the one tv is amazing only issue is installation no service from one in my town so be careful when you want to purchase remote not working after days worst

be loaded display issue while installation this issue itself checked by installation person came next day after delivery delivery service is quick i received next day after ordering picture quality is awesome price is apt but it gets heated up within two hours of functioning which is a concern otherwise can go for it at your risk volume is too low worst picture quality waiting for installation nice product from oneplus best at this price this product is good picture quality is very good sound quality is better value for your money don t get my oneplus remote with my oneplus y tv also don t receive the manual with aa batteries one plus says they give the best experience the only thing they are good at copy pasting the same response after continuous support seek the media could not be loaded picture quality is best for the price paid dislike for the speakers didnot like the audio quality connected my sound bar using bluetooth for better audio clarity worth the money voice of

headache in the future within months of purchase i could see a lot of dead pixels on screen i have complained several times and nobody has visited my house to have this fixed value for money good quality product buy without fear just awesome and the biggest part is a optical audio it s really amazing picture quality is like undescribable just go for it if you are watching from diagonal angles pictures quality fedsbut very bright and clear from front view the media could not be loaded just got the tv delivered today there is not even a single scratch on it thanks to the delivery service

sound quality is not up to the mark need extra speakers to feel good sound effects good one for this price worst tv worst service after taking tv with in days tv was not working service people was not responding already i have raised complaints but no use amazon service is worst dont by the product waste of money after installing the television it is important to give a service for uses manual how to operate because i am facing lots of problem pls help me out for this it is not upto expectations first of all puffin browser which is compatible with this tv is a paid app installation guy doesn t explain any features and he didn t wear mask at this covid time i like one plus led but amazon didn t provide me led wall stand and delivery man said we will provide you external but want extra money the media could not be loaded it is very slow the processor is really slow the picture quality isn t good the tv hangs very often require high internet connectivy to work at a decent pace overall fine sound is cracking picture quality very poor disappointed by the purchase i am using oneplus tv screen cast too slow first like fast delivery and smart futhers andand dislike is lag and slow sticking

smart tv and also one one is better quality product we were wait around one week to install tv picture quality is worstscreen is becoming orange colourtoo worst and too bad dislike is about service by amazon i order oneplus tv via icici amazon pay credit card but i didnot get cashback which is good tv but remote as compare to mi tv vs one plus tvmi tv remote connectivity is good its shocking that they mention its supports aux but there is no source for aux cable don t go for this tv there is a problem if you connect ps or any other console u will not able to play oneplus agrees there is problem if u connect ps remote response is slow all good so far software could be smoother and sound system too many settings to figure out the perfect oneremote control lags and sometimes can t command tv if it isn t pointing directly towards it nice tv this is a wonderful product and enjoy the picture quality and sound effects and mostly about great connectivity the line has formed within not even one month bought nd october i didn t expect it from one plus return time also closed by nov st i have claimed for servicing now when i connect tv to wifi operation working of tv is very slow and automatically tv goes for black screen same carry s for wen i am using mirror screeningi am very disappointed i called for installation tv amazon customer care told me that one plus doing these so i called one plus customer care told me that you buy tv from amazon so amazon doing installtion ok please don t buy it from amazon tv is not working at all and no one from amazon will entertain user complaint picture quality is not properly it s connect to the local cable network picture quality aur volume system achha hai par mobile se connect nahi ho raha hai product is not as much my expectation because of quality of audio and voice recognition is toooo worston full volume you cant listen clearlyand sound is too low comparetively to others leds nice but must use sound bar extremely poor performance lags like pentium trued to avail service and there s no ome available only bought it days ago now thinking about returning in days if no resolution reached very bad and arrogant installation person we don t want to this product any more we replaced this product very bad experience overall tv is good for the price the cons are sound quality not upto mark slow speed on startup and opening the apps good product i have been using the same since past days value for money product nice quality and best feature in tv i am a huge fan of oneplus disappointed with this oneplus tv tv is dead slow hangs from day apps crashes everytime oneplus always good but not provide wall mounted kit in tv box we need to buy it extra great tv in compare to sony bravia is matched the worst product by oneplus because this is slow actually slowest tv and laggy that much that you will get frustrated i am not abeling to watch my live cameras on this t v when i open the ezviz app the screen become very small and remote stop to work and options disappear on the screen what should i do good led tv in this price range good picture quality of tv is like a crystal awesome features all features wheather it s related to voice search sound quality every thing is very good tv remote is not working saying no signal while airtel dths remote is working is there any procedure to make it correct help me out best value for the money nice screen and colorsconslow quality soundapps are becoming slow by usage over all its okk too many display problems oneplus support is not good enough go with other brands this one isn t worth it nice design picture and sound quality the android os features are also really smart my feedback don t buy product in name of one plus very inferior quality of product no worth of buying sound quality is very low and i don t think it is dollby w it is worst than local speaker awesome television tv get hung most of the also remote bluetooth disconnect from tv very frequently then it take mins to reconnect remote it has some issues like not responding to inputs when hardware connected like pendrive it has app called connect to operate with mobile everything is top quality overall the tv is good after days of usage but there is a heating issue in the mother board mainly when i connected the usb drive very good product among the others in this price segment tv is okay not amazing but service was worst installation was not done and customer support not halping for installation bad review only becz of installation nice service from amazonnice sound picture quality is good but slightly changed while viewing from side angles casting is too slow may be due to low ram good tv in this price range video quality need to be improved sound quality is also not upto the mark very good product with good picture quality and added smart tv features however the audio quality could be better the maximum sound available is not enough in a spacious living room not recommended nice picture quality amazing colour sound is awesome smart tools with very smart feature of oxygen play value of money pathetic finishing though picture may be good but the gap between glas and plastic cover gives room for dust accumulation inside tv ok picture quality and sound quality is good no wall mounting stand includes no mm audio out port i but it few months ago the remote takes a lot of effort to work tv apps just randomly get lagged need to work on the processor it s oll good but remote control may be change i purchased it blutooth pairing problem always ask to pair when you on tv pathetic sound quality though the picture quality is good ui lags some times chromecast doesn t work smoothly worest installation service i bought the product one month ago still installation not complete picture quality is not as expected from oneplus brand other features are good enough for this price superb picture quality value for money would be more better if comes with a higher ram for fast loading overall good experience but only tv s frame disappointing me tv boundry like defective there is a gap between display frame not finishing excellent product from one plus but very poor service from amazon as the installation keep on rescheduled automatically and cancelled at last points for amazon for not looking after installation not good picture quality and hanging tv sounds very bad service problem atometic tv on of local tv i can t sedisfide not for value mony go for other brands the media could not be loaded i want to replace my tv already service executive came but can t resolve so do favour superb product in feature just disappointed by the display quality the sound quality of tv is horrible and hopeless i request you to process the refund and take back this item tv is good but sound should be improved so far everything is good but sometimes when we watching the tv with cable then suddenly disconnecting the cabel and displaying main menu apart from this syncing from mobile to tv is also bit slow everything is good except two things sound quality is bad speakers can t be connected through wires only bluetooth speakers can be connected to the tv it is a good product overall picture quality good sound quality average connecting is good design better than other products it is product so affordable price for this product nice
