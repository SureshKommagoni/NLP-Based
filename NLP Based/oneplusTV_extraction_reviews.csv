0,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Replacement received from Amazon and it's working fine,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Never expected to write a negative review for OnePlus Product !1. Screen Flickering is the most common problem2. Half of the times, TV doesn't start with a single button press.3. Booting takes atleast 20 seconds4. Screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time.5. Audio is dud - Not sufficient for my 10X10 ft bedroom6. System lag is the maximum in this class of TV'sEdit: 23/07/2020Amazon declined to replace and offered refund of 19,600/- as against 23k which I paid for the TV. All I have to do now is to live with a defective TV, as I had invested in the wallmount and the allied services. OnePlus SettledEdit: 27/07/2020Product is back in stock. Amazon accepted for replacement after technician report. But, defective product is yet to be picked up and the replacement is yet to be shipped. Awaiting further details. Brand is not at all acting in the customers interest. Very bad response for OnePlus.Edit: 6/8/2020Received the replacement TV from Amazon and the TV if working fine as of now. I installed it on the wall by myself. A bit of lag and sound issues, but the screen stuttering is gone."
1,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Cinematic picture quality with low quality sound bar,4.0,"TV is beautiful with minute bezels.I was pleased by the picture quality in firstI expected a smooth software from oneplus but TV operation is bit slow probably due to 1gb ram and lower clocked processor. Can't complaint at this price point. Wish oneplus would release better optimized software in update. Software update was one of my reason to buy TV from oneplus.Response from the bluetooth remote was bit slow.But hold bluetooth was very functional. Might be as it is bluetooth 5.0, TV was able to connect to 3+ devices at a time. 1 mobile, 1 bluetooth speaker and remote. That's great.Coming to sound, Speaker quality isn't upto mark. You have multiple options to enhance audio (dolby, surround, presets, dialogue enhancer etc) probably that's the reason oneplus skipped 3.5mm output and opted for optical and HDMI ARC ports to provide quality auido output on external speaker. You should go RCA audio adapters if you want 3.5mm input else connect to speakers using bluetooth adapter. That would cost additional if you want to.If you look for picture quality, minimal design and stick to few ott app this TV is for you.For power users and those who use only 3.5 jack to connect speakers look else where.Update :Oneplus released major update and UI and remote control navigation seems improved now.But setup of new Bluetooth connection got buggy. Im not able to connect to new devices. It is looping back to searching devices after clicking on device after search list"
2,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Y DIS Y series?,1.0,"ere is my experience with the Oneplus LAGGY tv32Y model. Here is a list of issues with your product.1. connected to Samsung mobile through google home as the tv isn't connecting through Samsung smart view. always says unable to connect, try again. And even through the google home, it is struggling too much to even cast the photos and forget about casting the videos.2. Neither windows nor Mac is recognising The tv in wireless mode. Had to use third party app from play store to Airplay my Mac n gues what, windows is not recognising the tv. It is really shocking to see Mac recognised where Windows couldn’t (using third party play store app).3. To my bad, even through third party play store app, it is laggy half of the times.4. And how can I ignore to say about Oneplus connect app, Its a wonders**t app, do the gesture wait for couple of seconds and then it responds and you can’t access files through the connect app on this tv.5. And sound, it has options by the name, dolby Audio and Dolby digital plus, fix this in your mind, these two features are just names and these does change the sound experience by zero percentage.6. On Youtube, video quality is limited to 1080p, best to use HDMi cable to your happy and play 4K, only then it felt better than any other video quality experience of this tv.7. Opening and closing apps, is like suspense thriller movie scene experience, you will be waiting to know when it will respond.sometimes suspense extends to 3-10 seconds.8. Viewing angles? acceptable for this price.9. Colors? Green is worst of all and then red , black is good, blue colors are worst, yellows are good and the rest that you find are acceptable.10. Display quality? If any of you ever used the Chinese phones of the last decade, you will get the exact same feeling. I promise you this.11. Best option to put  good use of display and colors is to use pen drive, hard disk or HDMI and play the 4k or full HD videos. This is the only way that this display can make you happy.12. And the remote, the menu button literally never worked on  any app nor on home page. It just exists with void function assigned to it.13. Almost forgot about voice search that is google assistance, 10 out of 10 times, it took 3-10 seconds to launch it.14. Opening an app, Fix in your mind that it will take at least 3-10.15. Once you connect Bluetooth accessory, you have to remove the device from the list, if you want to connect it to other device. you will not have an option to disconnect."
3,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"Contrast Ratio, Viewing Angle, Colours, All Good.",5.0,"I will be brief here.Unboxing:No wall Mount.No Display cables.Plastic stands.Thin TV.Pros:Contrast Ratio is Amazing. Black level is amazing.Viewing angles r fine.Awesome Colour accuracy.Latest Android version.Cons:Poor quality Speakers.Little bit laggy, probably the OS.The panel is awesome, TV won’t lag when playing video, and it’s really okay, android phones have similar issues.As for speakers, why would you use inbuilt speakers?What matters most is Contrast Ratio, Colour range, viewing angles, and clarity.They r all good in this price range, no 20k-35k 43” FULL HD TV could do better.AMAZON INSTALLATION:I didn’t get the wall mount, cause installation guys were charging me for it!TV is good, Amazon Service is getting poorer."

5,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),First to review Awesome TV with cherry on the cake.,5.0,"First to review 43y1, as my experience with 43 inch So far i liked the Tv.Tv is by default on energy saving picture mode, change to desire mode to get best picture experience, as i changed many picture settings the picture quality is way better than MI & realme me.Sound quality for my living room is more than enough, dolby atmos work carm with my Tatasky HD channels as they support dolby audio.The Lag is fixed to much extent.last input memory is also fixed, TV remembers the last input before switching off.The installation was bit crisp as the guy didn't turn on the promised date, so amazon escalated and yesterday new guy came and installated.Cherry on the cake the installation was free also the wall mount bracket worth Rs500 was provided free by the installation team.Installed and the demo was given very promptly.Also to be noted this 43 inches has different graphic processor than 32 inches G51 Mp3Updating my experience of 4 days -Experienced lag nly twice in 4 days.TV takes a approx of 1 min to get ON.There's a bit motion blur, which would be fixed by update, as it arises due to the DNR in the settings.Sound output is overall good at this range can't expect soundbar like bass.Pre-Book extended warranty has been activated and mail confirmation received from acko.Picture quality is just awesome, with setting proper backlight, contrast etc.Blacks are properly seen black.This has VA panel and i am not much concerned about viewing angles. VA Panels are best for the straight view angle as they produce good contrast and color reproduction,this TV does the same.Viewing angle can't be reviewed from my end as I did see blur when viewd at 150 angle which is obvious for VA panel.Data saver option and alexa support is yet to be updated in this TV.As of now no alexa support for this TV as there's no option to login to oneplus account, so my free echo dot is not of use with this TV as of now, may be they will provide the update to this.Updating my review with some test done1) RGB colour gamat test is performing perfectly on this TV. As you can see computer rgb reproduce proper color.2)motion blur is too much in this TV, expect to be fix via update.3) TV remote is Bluetooth and IR both, i turned of my bluetooth of Remote and using on IR as it's draining battery, when on IR you can't use Google assistant function.4) No support for Echo dot as of now confirmed, hopefully will be in update.5) No data saver option yet.6) backlight bleeding is present at 10% which is common for LED Tv.7) color reproduction is good too.Updating my review to some clarification and my experience 26/071) As echo dot is not compatible and no1 from oneplus has spoken about echo dot compatibility with Y series, i returned my echo dot for full refund.2)Those posting negative reviews due to echo dot not received, kindly add echo dot from cloudtail in cart with oneplus tv, u vll get it for free.3)Those posting negative reviews that after tv return oneplus gave nly 19965 rs, please return your echo dot too they remaining approx 3045rs will be refunded then only.4)I connected my JBl sound bar and watched movies on Prime , I bet the dolby atmos did its work 100%, and its natural u can't expect soundbar sound at 23k.5) pre-book cashback of 1000rs is credited to my amazon pay balance."
6,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Worst TV ever. Don't buy,1.0,I got it delivered by 21 july. Shipping was good but then bright spots started showing from the next day. Product quality isn't good too. I advise you not to buy this oneplus TV's
7,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Worthy in this budget segment TVs,3.0,"1. Picture quality is good. Look & Feel is good. I would quote ""Best in this segment TVs."" I have explored most of the well noted brands in this price segment.2. Sound is 3/5. With Dolby Digital Plus enabled, it is better.3. TV build quality is good, Viewing Angles are good too.4. 4K Videos will be reset to 1080p and this is the maximum resolution for any video.5. Only 4.6GB memory is available out of 8GB.6. Oxygen Play is useless.7. There is bloatware instead of oneplus clean software motto.8. Accessing Tv with Oneplus connect App is 1 out of 5. Its a disaster.9. Wall Mount is free. It will be brought by installation provider, do not shell extra bucks for wall mount or installation.10. Apps take ~10 sec to open, I am expecting optimization over next updates.11. USB Ports doesn't support FAT32 Memory sticks (Pendrive, Hard Disk, or Phone). I am disappointed for this one.12. Max viewing distance can be 8 feet. (My vision is 6/6 for both eyes)13. Though Google Play Store is given, you cannot install even google chrome. I see only Chinese apps are available even in google play store. Don't expect to install apps just like you do it on smart phone.14. No issue with remote and response time is good too. Remote build quality is good too.15. No heating issues noted so far.16. Supports only 2.4 Ghz band WiFi.17. No manual power switch. If remote doesn't work, it will be a hell with Tv.18. Chromecast has ~0.3 sec delay which is very bad if you connect with laptop and work with mouse/touch pad.Suggestion 1: If price is not a issue, go for Samsung or LG.Suggestion 2: Want to enjoy premium experience, buy premium Tv, do not expect to find it from Chinese brands. Time is money, the more time you spend in exploring the options and unboxing videos in YouTube, consider adding that amount to the TV you buy.Hope my review will be a help."

11,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Awesome!!!!,3.0,"Tv is awesome at this price.  Among all the competitors in this range of tv , oneplus tv is best.1. Viewing experience2. Sound3. Performance4. FluenceAll this upto mark.I'm giving 3 star because of the following reason.1. Oneplus connect app is not working with tv2. I'm unable to find any datasaver option3. Available storage is less"
12,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),A great product...!!!,5.0,"Was eagerly waiting for this Tv, it’s economically priced and I got it for 11.7k, super thin and lite weight..!! Thin Bezels and a absolute delight. Audio for a small room is great, bigger room it seems to be quiet less. Been using it whole day, just that one plus connect didn’t work with my iPhone and content from pendrive also not viewable at all, not sure if it’s supposed to be like that or there is some issue with the product.Called one plus customer care, who told One plus connect won't work for iOS, and suggested to long press the home button and select one plus server to connect android and to my surprise iOS also can get connected and works flawlessly.Moving on to the pen drive issue after a lot of research, trial and errors-It works only on the format FAT32."
13,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),OnePlus offers superb product quality. Value for money.,4.0,The video quality is good but  sound quality is average with marginal noise on higher volume. I have viewed Online content and seen DTH tv they  gives true colors and you will truly love it.Dolby sound quality is enough even for living room . For DTH opt for a Dolby supported settop box. I am using airtel xtream box (4k)which is only 2249 for airtel thanks customer .SOFTWARE lags at times and when you select Live TV at times it will not start and gets back to homescreen. Was able to mirror cast through oneplus connect. OnePlus connect app helps to use mobile as remote after the initial update. The viewing angles are ok but this is VA panel so nothing like IPS panel. OnePlus has done good job with regards to video quality as it gives DCI P3 color gamut . Google assistant works fine too. The best thing is the customer service OnePlus offers which is top notch and they listen to you with patience. After sales matter and customer service matter alot in this era. Overall worthy contender.
14,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),A Blot in the name of One Plus,1.0,"Bought during first sale on 5th July.This TV is a blot on the name of One Plus, they shouldn't have launched any product with such poor quality.Picture quality is very poor, colors doesn't look natural at all, tried all the color settings. May be good for a monitor but not definitely good as a TV.Sound quality is the biggest setback, it sounds like a 3rd rate speaker and sound isn't balanced. There is no clarity in the sound, you won't be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen.Frame of TV isn't durable, it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute.Summary: Don't expect anything good from this TV, this product doesn't deserve the One Plus brand name. One Plus should recall this product to maintain their brand image.I would have returned this product if there was an option."
15,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"Dont buy,Worst tv with bad display and sound disturbance",1.0,"Oneplus is settled for this cheap built quality,it comes with plastic body,screen is not at all good,if you pressure you can see liquid like flowing which we see in cheap quality products,sound is too worst,in an olden days when you full the volume you can get bad sound with disturbance now you can experience same with this tv"
16,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Value for money.,5.0,"Ordered on 18th and got it by 20th Afternoon, here's an honest review.But before that, here's a few tips for people who are going to buy it.You'll get an Echo Dot only if you order it with the tv at the same time, read the terms and conditions before leaving one star reviews because you didn't order the echo dot from your end and obviously didn't get it with the TV.To use the One Plus Connect app, you have to update the TV first, the OTA will be there when you turn on the TV for the first time.After that, open the connect server app on the TV, and then open the Connect app on the phone and it would work.Again, do a little research before leaving negative reviews and confusing the potential buyers.The type sync function(use the phone to type on the tv through the Connect App) doesn't work as of now, but would start working in the next app update. Head over to the community forum for the one plus tv to find more details.If you talk about hardware, the TV is flawless, those who are complaining about the TV simply have a bigger room that the TV is designed for. You can always buy a soundbar if you think the volume isn't sufficient for your room. For me, it's more than enough.The display is top notch and the colors are vibrant. It's truly bezel-less and looks beautiful.About the software, there are a few misses here and there, but I'm sure it can be fixed through a software update.ScreenCast lags a lot, I'm waiting for an update to see if it's fixed.To people who think that the TV lags a lot, think of the TV as a phone with 1 GB RAM, if you keep opening apps repeatedly in a short period of time, the phone would lag, same is the case with the TV.It's a value for money for those who don't wanna spend a fortune to get a TV with a good display."
17,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Amazon failed to give me my Echo Dot which was supposed to be delivered at no charge.,4.0,"Firstly I did not receive my Amazon Echo Dot at no cost as promised.So I'm really pissed off however I liked the tv, good in quality and sound is pretty loud too.It's absolutely slim and sleek.Beautifully designed.Kudos to designed team.Easy to browse through apps and quick and easy to connect to phone especially one plus phones.Screen cast is just a click away.Gotta do some more research on One Connect App.It's giving me some hard time to connect to the TV."
18,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),A Perfect TV For Casual Users Who Simply Want To Enjoy Content,5.0,"I bought this TV in the first sale on 5th July and have been loving it. Amazon installation was prompt and it was set up the same day as the delivery. It is pretty light and slim, as given in the specs.The picture quality is fabulous, colors are right and everything about the display is better than normal. As a normal user, you wouldn't notice any point of complaint regards to display.Speakers are loud enough, and we are bound to mostly use it at 25% of the maximum volume. Dolby surrounds sound is an added benefit that does enhance the sound experience of the TV.It runs Android 9.0 out of the box with Oxygen Play as the skin and the UI is pretty simple. It automatically fetches major information from the apps that you add to the home screen given you have signed in if required. The animations and transitions between application is sleek and there is no lag whatsoever. If you have used an android phone, the UI is no alien and the navigation will seem very familiar.The connectivity ports provided are ample and the WiFi reception is also pretty strong. I don't know about the bells and whistles that other TVs come equipped with, but as a normal user who wants to enjoy his shows, videos, and cinema on a smart TV from all the contemporary sources like prime video, Netflix, youtube, etc., this is the perfect option."
19,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),12.9 K not worth for this type of quality,1.0,"It just got delivered on the second day of sale,fixed also, installation was done above 6 feet,1.Sound quality is not good.2.Remote is not actual bluetooth as it doesn't sense 100%.3.With this price range we could have gone with the other brands.4.Only buy if you are 1+ lover other wise its not worth.."
20,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Detailed Guidance and Analysis of the TV for all Prospective Buyers and Confused Buyers,4.0,"Overall Analysis and Reviews for all prospective buyers -1. Picture Quality -The TV is definitely a worthy purchase as its Picture Quality is by far the best in class in compared to other competitors.Build Quality too is Good.The bezel and screen is definitely a Masterpiece as the Bezels are indeed Minimum & the way the screen is built is extremely Unique and different than other competitors.Can't comment on Viewing Angles as honestly I am not an expert also most people watch TV directly in straight direction and all these Viewing Angles talk is just a gimmick to confuse you all.2. OSEarlier reports were that the TV is very laggy especially w.r.t 32inch however I did not experience much lag. One needs to understand that in this segment all competitors offer similar config of Ram and Processor which are definitely not high-end HOWEVER like how it has been hyped on Lag part .. I found it to be rather untrue as Lag exists but not to a huge extent.OnePlus own software optimization is amazing as really clean and bloat free.The TV remembers the last input and so turns on by default on the said input mode on boot-up.Tv has a unique style of Boot Up and Shut down method as on single power off press it seems TV is more on standby mode and only on Long Press of power off will the TV shutdown completely.Boot up timing is good as its not too delayed.3. Sound - Major let down as sound is definitely not at all.upto the mark however this is problem which is common amongst all competitors as each hv low Quality speakers only.I already have a soundbar so this aspect anywhich ways had 0 impact as all competitors fail in sound aspect in these cost segment of TVs totally per my experience.4. Accessibility of Ports - Perhaps the major let down for me are the accesibility of the ports as they are not at all User Friendly and not readily accessible specially for people who have opted for Wall Mount like in my case.The downward location of Port is the most Negative aspect for me.However as I hardly use ports much so again not a major impact however for others it can seem to be a problem mainly for users who have more requirements of port like hdmi and all however with an HDMI extender you will be good to go just an investment of 200-300 rs for an extender may be required.Table Top installation people have nothing to be worried off. This is least concern for them.5. Connectivity - Though a single band wifi Router Exists, the same works absolutely fine and 0 loss or issues atleast till now.6. Installation - Installation was a bit challenge mainly due to screw-up by Third party responsible for installation however with Amazon Escalation it was handled timely and despite hiccups TV was installed on the scheduled date only by EOD.There's a lot of confusion with regards to Wall Mount, well let me be clear that Wall Mount is totally Free and nothing needs to be paid at all.Beware that Installation guy may make some charge and ask to pay however fight back, escalate, talk to their Manager or ask for official bill and you will be good to go as nothing will be charged then.Only lack of clarity remains is around the type of Wall Mount used, as in my case , the guy used an generic brand wall Mount bracket and it is not at all clear whether Oneplus has their own branding of Wall Mount.. Maybe others can add-on.7. Remote - Remote design and all is pure beauty with minimalistic design however dont know where the issue seems to be with Remote or otherwise as it could be like at-times mutilple times pressing could be required especially to Turn On the Tv. Not sure whether its remote lag or otherwise - Maybe Oneplus can fine tune with update.Overall Analysis & Recommendation -Tv is definitely highly recommend for people priority and focus is Picture Quality and OS (highly recommended for OTT users like me) .Bedroom TV - Best Choice 💯If you have soundbar then don't think otherwise as its the best option from others outhere literally.MI TV and All completely fail in comparison to this.Got free Echo Dot too.. Many complained of not getting as they did not read the offer properly as the speaker needs to be added in cart along with TV inorder for promo to apply automatically.TV is not Alexa based and so could not completely reap the benefits of the same with Echo however maybe with update this could be sorted too.Also for OTT users like me it should have an option that on Boot-up TV starts at Google Launcher page only - Again update can take care of this .A word of advice for all confused buyer's - read my above detailed guide and then take a call.Nevertheless, you won't be regretted at all with this TV. OnePlus has definitely delivered its premiumness with this TV for sure and which is highly visible too.Will update the reviews if add-on or change of facts.What more are you looking out for .. simply buy this TV.Never Settle !!!😍"
21,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Failed at audio category and ports design,1.0,No audio out for the TV never tust a new brand on an entry level...if picture quality is your only pripority then go for it because that sound is worst as hell.. I don't consider price point because 13000 is not a small amount for many people. I planned to connect it to a external.speaker but the port is missing. No digital audio.out nor the traditional 3.5mm out. Highly disappointed in audio category..
22,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Bad Experience...Bad Product...Bad Service,1.0,"Absolute Disaster.....1. Echo Dot was free along with the product. But I got to know that it needs to be added while ordering. But when something is free with order, why it is required to be added. Simply to fool people.Very disappointed with Amazon this time. Really really bad.2. There is a blue flash which appears while the tv is on repeatedly.3. Sound is the worst you can think of.Overall a bad decision. Both Oneplus and Amazon have been disappointing."
23,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Amazing Tv from One Plus,5.0,"Very nice Tv in this price range from one plus.Picture quality is superb...Sound quality is ok ok but better than MI TV'sBuilt quality is also goodTv looks premium because of Bezel less design.Remote controller is also made of good quality plastic and it is very good looking, hotkeys are provided for Netflix, Prime video, YouTube and Google Assistant.Overall it's very good and budget Tv from brand like one plus compared to MI , Realme, VU, Thomsan etc."
24,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Not expected from OP,3.0,"Looks Great. Colours are Amazing. However, user Experience is not refined at all for Oneplus standard and even for any other standards for that matter. Will edit the review once OnePlus fixes below issues.Below are some of the bugs I observed in the last 2 days. Needs immediate attention from OP Software Team to protect OP's reputation.1) Very laggy interface across all apps including home screen, play store, voice assistant. Netflix etc.2) When the TV is off, power button had to be pressed couple of times before the TV could turn on3) When the TV is off, Bluetooth keeps connecting back and disconnecting from TV (Alexa keep saying got connected to Oneplus TV every few mins when used as a external speaker even when TV is off)4) TV also takes time to register inputs from OP Connect app. No keyboard on OP connect app. After restart again need to open Connect app on TV for OP Connect app on mobile to detect OP TV.5) Customize Channels on the homescreen keeps getting reset6) Even when no input is connected to the TV, the TV boots to one of the inputs (HDMI/Channel Scan) instead of home screen.7) Menu button hardly has any use on home screen and only works when used with external inputs.8) There is no option to adjust colours/sound in realtime with hardware remote (i.e.while watching media on TV)9) Alexa app does not recognize the TV even after adding and linking Account in Oneplus TV skillI guess can't be fixed with Software but still want to capture for records (While watching from straight gives great picture quality in the class, viewing angles are pretty bad compared to competition)"
25,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Bang for bucks,5.0,"Got this tv as a cheap and small entertainment unit for my bedroom. Below are the quick pointers:Pros:1. Overall design is very sleek with almost non-existent bezels on three sides. Back mount is available, along with two plastic feets that hold the tv up nice and firmly however you install it. Enough connectivity options incl HDMI arc, optical, spdif and they work as intended.2. Standard smart remote with Netflix, Prime, YouTube and Google assistant buttons. Please note that you have to pair the remote with the tv for the first time before you can use the Bluetooth mode (search in web).3. The display is pretty good with excellent color accuracy though there's no HDR/Dolby Vision support. However, I've seen the HDR implementation in cheap TVs, and I'd rather have overall bright and uniform screen which this tv provides. Minimum backlight bleeding. Slight loss of brightness at high angles of viewing but pq remains same.4. Sound quality is pretty average, but loud. It's good enough for a 10/10 room but at more than 50% volume, the dialogues become difficult to understand. I've heard the speakers in other sub 30k sets and this one is definitely among the top 3.5. Inbuilt Android 9 OS is pretty good, have access to almost all the entertainment apps that work out of the box. There's a bit of lag at times when switching apps and scrolling the menu but it's not too distracting.6. Works great with Google home and offers full voice control. Inbuilt Chromecast is fast and connects quickly. You can also cast video from laptop using Chrome/VLC/other cast apps.Cons:1. Only 768p though YouTube will go to full hd. Given the price point, it's fair, but a full hd panel would've been worth more to both consumers and company. At close distance, you can see the LEDs but more than 3ft, you're game.2. No 5ghz WiFi band support, but that's alright because sub hd content will not need more than 5-10mbps at max. Channel congestion can be a problem if you have too many devices connected to the 2.4ghz band, so keep that in mind.3. Remote lags a bit post cold startup. Especially in apps like Hotstar. Maybe software update will fix."

   No doubt TV is value for money but has few small issues.1. It doesn't gets on with single press of power button on remote.2. It is a bit slow because of 1GB RAM.3. Sound quality is not a expected.Few people mentioned about not receiving free echo dot.

32,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Amazing TV at this price range.,5.0,Display quality is top notch. Even though it's FHD. And for the sound quality. I also had issue with it. But first go in sound setting and turn on surround sound and dolby sound. And then feel the real sound this TV can provide. Earlier i had an issue with TV not being able to turn on by remote. But after reading the manual i cane to know that to turn on TV it uses IR blaster on remote like old days unlike bluetooth. So u have to point it directly to the right bottom of the TV. A splendid purchase for the price. Really happy. And the display is really punchy and colour accurate.

75,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Good for the price.,5.0,"Overall it's a good TV for the price. I got the 43"" TV , echo dot and 3 years of warranty.I did find it a bit laggg initially, but seemed better after the first update. The wall mount took an additional ₹800."
76,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Best choice for 13k,5.0,"Like this tv very much. Better picture quality, good sound and connection.

79,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Best picture quality good sound,5.0,Tv is looking great physically and also its interface easy to useOnly one problem i am facing that  is connecting the tv to the settop box through hdmi 2 port always mute the audio after power on but hdmi 1 arc port is working fine . Also i cannot control the volume of the tv in the settop box using settop box remote on Dolby mode
80,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Woww factor for brand name,5.0,"I purchased this only for the brand name. You get a woww factor when you say you have one plus Tv.Other than that it is pretty normal TV for this price range. You get cheaper (1-2k) Tv from Thompson, Mi and VU for this price range. So you are actually paying 1k for this brand value and nothing else as the specs and performance match with other Tv brands.Display quality is very good and sound could have been better, these are on par with other TV on this same price range. Down firing speakers make sound little muffled.Casting works perfectly in both android and iPhone. Airtel Xrteam or jio live tv app is not available for any TV models but you can run it on phone and cast it to TV. So you don’t have to purchase a DTH or cable with smart TV with built in chromecast.TV does become slow when you open multiple apps but this is problem in all budget Tv models.2 hdmi ports is not a problem at all. As mostly you would only use 2 ports. 1 for dth and 1 for playstation. Since moving to OTT we no more use DVD or blue ray players. Also chromecast is inbuilt, so there is really no need for 3rd hdmi cable."

94,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),A strict No-No. Worst product by OnePlus,1.0,"Had an extremely poor experience with OnePlus TV.TV screen turns black on random occasions but frequently, it again turns back on in 30sec to 5 min.Sounds stops working similarly.Picture turns green randomly.This doesn't feel like a OnePlus product. Even local brands provide better products.After all this, i applied for replacement and then amazon scheduled an inspection service and the inspection guy didn't show up. Had to rescheduled it two more times but no one shows up. Contacted amazon and told the whole scenario then they replaced it directly.Got the replaced product but the issues are still there and this time the product feels like second hand. Only that this time the issues ka worse and more frequent that last one.Filed a return request, again got inpection service scheduled and after explaining previous experience to customer care, this time got a call from inspection guy. He made a video of the issue. He said that he has verified the issue but I did not receive any response from Amazon regarding this.And the worse thing, Amazon is not providing customer care support now. Tried multiple times but didn't recieve any call from Amazon. Feeling stuck with this defective product.Won't be using Amazon for a long time now.Update: After initiating the return order again, Amazon sent people for picking up the defective item. Now waiting for refund initiation."

   It's awesome tv at 13k, except for viewing angles.It's color production and lookwise it's unmatchable.From front on it matches any full HD TV, interface is smooth.Color production is really good, blacks are really black like OLED panelFrom sides it's colors fade is noticable, it's the only but big negative from OnePlusWhen it comes to sound it is good while streaming through apps like YouTube, hotstar,, with set of box it's bit low.No lag in OS, remote is easy to operate and premium look.After 6 months usage , it's going great and really satisfiedAfter almost 1 year usage I'm satisfied with this TV , picture quality is of high class, one issue noticeable is there is a 3 mm gap at the base frame, not a major concern but OnePlus need to take care.If you are using it only with set of box use a good hdmi cable , it will really enhances viewing experience. With AV cables you will get very poor picture quality.It's one year of moderate use , but I'm getting back light issues on screen, currently it's not a issue while watching , but if it continues to intensity it will be a issue, I didn't expect that within a year."

   Respected viewer,I know before purchasing this expensive leisure you will be viewing the rewievs let me tell you this TV has a great picture quality and smart features but this crashed in just 3 days of use . I purchased this TV long time back and it was kept in one corner of my house and then after a hell lot of scams one fine day a totally unprofessional fellow came to install it ...... After damaging the whole wall with innumerable drills he installed it and didn't even explain the features which , somehow , we got to know about.....then he charged the double price for the wall mount.....then after thousands of complaints finally we got a refund. Would suggest to buy from a showroom. Hope you find it helpful but informally would like to tell if you don't want to fall in any sort of problem .... Then please don't purchase this product !Have a good day"

125,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"Smart TV which isn't that ""smart""",3.0,"If you're going to purchase this product make sure you have atleast 4gb / day data plan dedicated to this TV.Also you need a WiFi router for getting full functionality.Let me start with the pros1. Picture quality is great. You'll need some Tweeks though. Set it on movie preset for day time use. Energy saving for night time use. I reduced backlight to 20 and it's in user mode to reduce eye strain.2. Audio quality is good. You also need a lot of Tweeks though.Set it in movie preset if you're watching movies. This preset let's you hear all the music details also you'll hear the dialogues crystal clear. In this mode you won't hear bass that much. You'll get a hint of base nothing much. Because base will affect the Dialogues.Set it in music preset if you're listening to music in this preset you'll hear all the highs and lows crystal clear. You'll get bass as well.Okay now discuss about the consEverything else in this TV is a con.It has data saver installed but you can't able to access it. Data savers has an update in playstore. For some reason it's not updating.You can't use this TV as a Bluetooth speaker. You have to cast your phone screen in order to play your music on TV screen.Which brings a lot of problems. First you need a WiFi router with 2 GB data dedicated to this TV for casting only. Because it's using Chromecast not miracast. So what happens is, you are sharing your mobile screen to your TV using mobile data even though it's on same network. Which is stupid. Why in the world I have to spend my data to transfer the data packets using my router. It's on same network for god's sake.Also while casting if you open YouTube in your phone it opens YouTube app on tv, so you'll end up spending 3X data for playing YouTube video. ( For playing in mobile, for transferring data to tv and for the video playing on TV). But fellow competitors like mi TV also have built in Chromecast only. I don't know any budget TV which supports miracast, if you knew comment below to let me know.It can only access hard disc upto 2tb.Some apps like Udemy are not supported on this TV.You're going to spend more money on ott, let me explain how.. if you're going to use Netflix on TV you'll need premium subscription to add 2-4 devices at a time. Also if you have Airtel xstreme on your phone, and thinking I can use Airtel xstreme on tv.. you're wrong.. you need to purchase xstreme for TV as well.If you're rich enough to purchase all ott platforms and have enough money to spend 4gb / day data on TV on regular basis, you'll love this TV.Otherwise you're gonna end up hating this TV and yourself for purchasing this TV.I chose to purchase this TV because it's an Android TV, also home services during warranty period is free. I don't have to take this TV to the service centre, if there's something's wrong. After warranty period they charge ₹450 for the service. Which is cheaper than other brand.But if I knew I'm gonna get this for ₹16k I wouldn't even think about purchasing this TV. Because I got these picture and audio in my old Sansui LCD tv. Which lasted 5 years without any issues."

130,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Deep review after using 43ye for more than a month.,3.0,"After using 43y1 for 1+ monthBought this OnePlus 43y1 android tv for a very cheap price, but the product isn't upto oneplus standards.The picture quality is OK, and sometimes it gets flaky and dark for no reasons. Once i fiddle around with the picture settings this issue fixes, but it happens frequently. It's like the tv is unable to remember the picture settings.Sound quality is also just about OK. There's like literally no bass. Doesn't matter how many different audio settings you try, the audio is weak. But, you could say, ""Itna paisa me itna-ich milega"".Important issues:The tv hangs, it just freezes, not very much, but once in every 3-4 days. Then you have to restart it from the main switch.Many times there's no audio. Doesn't matter which input you try. To fix this I have to restart the tv from the main switch.I sometimes connect bluetooth headphones to my tv. To connect it the first time, obviously, pairing is required. But, to connect it the second time, I have to unpair my headphones, and then again pair it. Otherwise the headphones won't connect automatically. And there's no option to search manually for previously connected devices. Every time I have to unpair and then pair the bluetooth device.The tv remote hangs too. Not all the times. Mostly it works very smooth, but sometimes it hangs. I think this issue is because sometimes the remote doesn't get connected to tv via Bluetooth.Not to forget the tv doesn't have a 3.5 mm jack.You cannot access tv settings while you are using any app. You will have to close the app and go to home screen to change audio/video settings, etc.Netflix only works in HD quality. There's no FHD support for Netflix. I use 4k Netflix subscription, but on this tv it only works in HD.The Alexa support is still not available in the tv. I just cannot connect my Amazon Echo device to the tv. Tried everything, every steps i could find on the internet over several forums. At the end a OnePlus official answered my query on one of OnePlus official forums that the Alexa support will be made through an app, which will be released shortly. The app isn't released till date.Overall, I five 3.5 stars to the tv. Just because of price and remote design. There's nothing else special about the tv."

The TV on the hardware front is really good. But the software in the TV is really sad. There is a lot of time lag when you are casting to the TV. Sound goes immediately but the video lags by more than 10-20 seconds. The TV also keeps giving out a Google Assistant error message randomly. There were times when the audio error message was made in the middle of the night when the TV was switched off. Unless the software is upgraded or rectified, I wouldn't recommend this TV.

No installation wall mount bracket with TV, need to purchase it seperately. It's a made in India product and plastics, sockets and fit n finish is not as good as its Chinese counterparts like MI, VU and others.Worst installation service, after 16 days still no installation.

Remote design absolutely poor engineering remote design. It's not handy to use, hold and stupid placement of keys in the remote made. Poor engineering design products.

Okay that's fine it can happen with any product right? It took almost 2 months to get a service guy, that's also fine even though I had no entertainment at home because of the lockdown going on everywhere.All of sudden a service guy came like an angel and said I have to pay for the service as the board is burned it won't comes under their warranty policy. Great!I have been using a VU tv for the past 4 years that too got damaged but replaced with a brand new TV twice without even any questions asked.

147,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Not that great,3.0,"The TV is an okay-ish buy.Don't come for the Brand here.I would happily suggest anyone to go with a Samsung or even Onida TV which does come at a nearby price point.The sound is low, but what to expect from a 20 Watt internal speaker.Even though it is back-lit with LED, there are certain points where you will not be able to see anything, it will be pitch black, while it should have been normal.And for the Game Mode, I used my PS4, XBOX ONE and Switch along with that. Played a couple of matches in Battlefield 1 and WWII. It reduces lag, but not upto a gaming level.The remote cannot start the tv all the time.It is slow when it comes to remote response, but that is only for the start up.But at this price point, what can one expect.And, at the time of writing this review, I had a serious issue a few days back, but the inputs from HDMI produced a grayscale output.I thought the TV was done for.But, it happens across all the OnePlus TV's it seems.If anyone has the same issue, reset the entire TV.I wasted some time with Amazon and OnePlus Care by scheduling repair services.But it was no good.All in all, I love One Plus, despite the negative points stated, the above has 2 stars for Amazon and 1 for the TV.If you want to try this one, gladly you are welcome, but I would suggest you to try another brand, specifically well established ones like Samsung or Sony or TCL or Onida."

The colours are not great either. Does not have different picture/colour modes. The biggest con for me is that it does not have adaptive display and gets too bright in low light while in standard settings.Overall - for the price of ₹22K - ₹23K the TV is totally worth buying. Remember that this is a budget tv. Premium TV's are almost double the cost."

   Alright, here is the new One Plus TV 43Y. You can watch Unboxing on my you tube channel X:Plorer!.I have been using this tv since a week now.Here are some pros and cons of the tv,Pros: Price, yes being a Indian we always seek products which are best quality with affordable price, It fits well.#Gift: Yes, you get Alexa Dot with OnePlus 43Y and 55 U TVs. Who don't like free stuff?#Picture Quality is super with baseless design of 88% of total view. Viewing angel will give you great experience.#Build Quality: I have been trying different TVs till now including Mi 55 inch, Iffalcon 43inch and other but trust me this One Plus is far ahead when it comes to design and quality material.Cons:#Sound: Yes it has 20wt output sound with Dolby Atmos but you won't feel bass.#RAM: It has 1GB RAM with internal storage of 8GB out of which only around 4 GB is useful. This would make operation lit slow.#Andoid oxygen play: It's hardly has watchable content and it's too old as there is Patch wall."

Every time when I tried the voice command, the ongoing video/movie stuck. The picture and sound quality are not so great for a room of 100 sqft and there was a lot of glare even with less light in the room, tried all the suggestions on changing contrast/brightness etc., By looking at the hype, I expected a lot but this TV did not meet any of my expectations and left a disappointing experience."

No bass which is a huge disappointment.Alexa is not bundled, you need to add it separately during the purchase.@Amazon, when you mention that Alexa comes free with this purchase then make it bundled with the TV unit and do not ask Customers to add it separately during the purchase. Don't expect the Customers to add it separately during the Flash sale. This is simply cheating on the Customers."

Cuz it’s going to be like solving a puzzle what went wrong & what possibly can be right and after all of that the remote will give you a run which you never wanted.I can go on… but not worth my time.Just one thing if you think of buying CHEAP, you can opt for TCL instead but these are just junk covered with a shiny plastic and a good outlook."
170,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Great display with poor sound and slow/lagging interface,3.0,"It's been 10 days I am using this TV... honestly the display quality is just amazing and the truly bezel less display looks incredible. However, I am disappointed with the sound quality it's doesn't sound good, I think becoz the speakers are down facing, but if u have a external speaker( which I have) thn it's not the issue. Another problem is that TV is not that smooth and it lags a lot of times. Hopefully OnePlus will send will fix it with the update. Overall I am happy becoz sound issue is not a big deal as I use a speaker which everyone should, if you want to enjoy movies on prime and Netflix. Lagging issue will b fixed becoz I trust OnePlus, as thr Service is really good. Overall it's not a bad deal seeing the amazing display and stylish looking frame."

Although the product has Dolby Digital surround sound but still it feels a bit low output in terms of voice2. The operating remote feels a lag when you switch on the T.V.3.

It serves all the purpose very well.. all smart features are excellent, connectivity is so good.. picture quality and sound is absolutely fine and sufficient for me. People complaint about its picture & sound quality but I found it amazing.. I don't expect any better clarity of picture than this TV.. and sound.. I couldn't use it on more than 10% volume in my 100 sq ft room. Guys It's just a TV, it could be bad, good or excellent.. for me it's Excellent.. I am not looking for a wife here.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣And people who are being so critical about this TV, I don't know what are they were expecting.. may be they are comparing this TV with a PVR screen, or its sound with a bose music system then definitely it's a below expectation product for you, sorry for your loss."

I used a Samsung Smart TV before this and its output itself sounded as if it was from a home theatre but the same output from Oneplus was pathetic. I even tried all their settings and features available. I then ordered a JBL Infinity home theatre only for the sound thing and then connected it over Bluetooth. It was then beautiful and perfect. But after a couple of days there was a lag between the TV sound output and that from the Home theatre. I then replaced the JBL thing from Amazon and to my surprise found out that even the next one had a similar issue after a couple of days.I'm still worried if the Bluetooth feature of Oneplus TV has an issue or just my specific piece. This review of mine doesn't judge Oneplus TV at any side. It's just my experience. Other than the Bluetooth lag at some times, everything is at it's best and you can go for it without a second thought."

I don't know when can I get resolution. After 10months my warranty period will be over, I dnt have hopes.Please think before you buy.This is my personal experience. Iam not enforcing anyone.This is after 90days , I opened a ticket 2months back but till now there is no resolution. Customer care guys just closing the ticket and asking feedback, there main focus is on feedback not on resolution.Other side I escalated to Amazon still there is no resolution.  I don't know when I can get resolution"

After 6 months, one fine day, I couldn't turn on the TV. Since I have paid for extra warranty, I contacted Amazon for technical support. I scheduled the appointment 4 times.

I have started facing lag, glitches, screen freeze since Feb 2021. Since then it's been 20-30 calls to customer care , 10 service schedules and on hold status. You will not get any help from Amazon or Qdigi (one plus partner). It's a bad launch.

198,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Dont buy this.. Struggle to service,1.0,"First I received this product with a different stand and they send a replacement for this. All this process took around 1 month. Finally, I got a working product.After using it for 6 months, we were watching the TV suddenly it stopped working. I raised a complaint immediately. I waited for few days and started calling customer care. Every day, the phone will be attending by different executives they will tell theirs on stories. It will be assigned to Technician or the call with escalated to you will get a call back so and so... After a month and half the complaint got assigned to a technician and without visiting the site they told they have ordered for parts.During all this time, we were using our old TV. Good that we haven't sold.At last, they came the home with a TV and exchanged some parts with our TV. The TV is working.. but one issue. The TV display is coming opposite side. If we rotate the TV only we will be able to see. Now they told me there are no settings in the remote to change the direction. They will come with software to resolve this issue.  Again the service person came and tried to fix it but still, it's not resolved.Now they want to take the TV to service place and we have to get it from there. Not sure how much time it will take.This is my experience with the OnePlus TV. I would suggest don't go for this product.. If you still want to buy then arrange an alternative and be ready."

I recommend buying a soundbar3) does not power on by single click from remote.

(Those who have missed Echo Dot, I feel very sorry for them)Also Alexa worked me as a smart connector between TV and my Sony home theatre system, without any digital cables or converters ..! Saved my money there too..!!1. Picture Quality : Is pretty good and 1080i LED display. Viewing angle should be straight and if it’s more than 30degree picture clarity will reduce and colours starts fading. Make sure you are straight infront of TV view.2. Sound Quality : is ok kind of Quality at this price as I am depending more on home theatre speakers, thus it’s good for me.3. Value for money : yes definitely you can choose at this budget unless like other brands of this range and it’s 43”.5.chromecasting is built-in, can avail from IOs platform too as I am using it..!4. Includes all the modern smart tv features like Netflix, amazon,YouTube and google assistants in one single button. But some time-lag can be experienced while changing the input sources.Even google assistance is bit slow to catch-up when compared to Alexa..!Overall I can give  ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️Thanks Team Oneplus and Amazon.in"

204,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Truly smart tv... value for money definitely..,5.0,"Smartest smart tv from oneplus..in this price range no other TV's has such picture quality and features..its totally premium product..just one thing pls buy soundbar or any sound system with this..this tv has dolby digital, dolby digital plus, surround sound...which are awesome functions indeed but u can feel these features only if u have external sound system . Else the speakers of 10w each are very low in volume..a good movie with sound effects cant be enjoyed at all..else this tv is highly recommended. All the features works perfectly as the company says in ads. Value for money indeed.One update after using the tv for 1.5 month-1. Never faced problems like auto restart, lags, etc. But yes if u install loads of apps then u should wait few seconds when u start the tv else u will see lil lags..but after few seconds it will run smoothly.."

Features are also impressive. But the rigidity of the TV is questionable.Installation Service by One Plus was very poor. The installation was scheduled between 2-6pm and they reached around 6.30pm and left around 8.45pm. The Fixed wall mount used was in rusted condition. And they drilled total 5 holes on the TV Mounting board for 4 screw!! and the Wooden board got damaged. The TV was tilted to one side after installation and then they had to use small paper pieces to level the TV ! For the fixed TV mount the charge was rs 500 even though the charge written in amazon is rs 299 for a 43"" TV!!"

The picture quality and sound quality is very poor comparing with his TV. The remote control and voice recognition is perfect. But the clarity of display is very bad according to MI TV. Till the reviewing date there is no inbuilt apps for screen casting,etc. We should seperatly want to download Airscreen app from play store. For installing other apps this TV not have file manager to download apk from USB, we should also want to download that from play store. I am damn sure that My friends MI TV is better than oneplus TV. My rating to this TV is 2.5/5.Not worth this TV for 12,999.better go for MI tv or other brands like tcl, realme, etc. I think that Oneplus will overall these products, but in case of TV till I am putting the review MI TV is good by comparing with my friends TV."

   This review is in usage of 9 months. Worst product from OnePlus. I just don't even understand why they had to come into TV. My personal opinion always go with Sony or LG. It is the best.2nd time issue with the display.First issue arrived after 4 months I bought the TV. Same as you see in the picture. (This image is second time issue)But it was working for 30 mins and it started to fade away. I usually don't use the TV much so I didn't care about it for 2 months. Then it started to fade forever. So had to book a service. Nonsense in this pandemic. It took 2 months to fix.Fine atleast some picture to see in the second lockdown after the service. And it didn't like to work after 1 month after the 1st service. Same kind of issue. This image is reference after 1st service done to display. (Changing the whole display).I personally recommend Sony of LG. They are best in TVs. Ofcourse they are high priced for what reason you guys might think. This is the reason.These guys, I just don't understand why did I even step foot in these kinds of company's for a different product. They are utter waste of time and money. I have used the TV only for 6 months. That's it.And I'm in second services with one year.Bullshit what others think about this TV or the brand. Shame to say I'm oneplus user for 7 years now.Cheap quality displays they use. So is the lowest price."

209,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Budget TV BUT NOT GREAT,5.0,Pixel quality is ok. You can easily notice it with different colours. Using android enabled smart tv hence have same emotions like the way android works or probably the function processing capability of the tv is not at par. Tv Remote sensor works only in you are in range of 2 metres irrespective of inserting battery cells. I feel my Tata sky remote sensor was out of the world since it use to capture signals from any corner of the room where my old tv was installed.Piece of advise if you money to spend go for another brand or device altogether and you limited on budget I would recommend you to with this tv

216,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Amazing Value for Money,4.0,"The product itself is great value for money for less than 25k for a 43 inch Android LED TV. Overall picture quality is great at normal viewing angles but the colours shift slightly at extreme wide viewing angles. But it will be good enough in most situations.There are lot of picture and sound settings, it also supports Dolby. You can easily connect your Bluetooth headset or soundbar. Sound quality lacks bass and punch, it's not great for movies or songs, but enough for usual News and Sports. For movies I suggest to use dedicated soundbar or home theatre. Remote control has only Bluetooth functionality. No infrared, so battery drain might be faster. Sometimes TV lags to recognize remote operation.TV stand is plastic and feels kinda weak. It wobbles a bit when you nudge the screen. There is no AUX output. Only optical for audio out. Apparently HDMI ARC is there. But haven't tried it.WiFi connectivity is good and fast, though it connects only to 2.4GHz bands. TV has only 1GB RAM so it tends to lag a bit while running more than 2 apps in background. But it's acceptable in normal circumstances. There seems to be no surge protection so better to connect it to a stabilizer if your electricity fluctuates often.USB pen drives can be connected and we can also choose different audio languages in the movie files if available, which is great.It's a great TV for the price. More worth than Sony or LG which are well above 35k for Android models of same size. I think it has a better display than MI TV, Panasonic or Realme TV."
217,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"Very slow, Worst Sound Quality",1.0,"I used this for more than 8 months, finally put the tv for exchange when it was still under warranty, couldn't tolerate the awfulness anymore.  It was very slow even when there are only 5 apps installed, I literally have to wait for nearly a minute to switch to another app and play a movie, Sound Quality was very poor, if there's some bass in any scene that am watching there is an irritating static noise. Big mistake to have bought this seeing one plus brand name. Mi has better tv in the same price range. Don't think there will be negative reviews for all the brands and avoid what am writing, am serious and writing this out of frustration, please avoid this tv."

To switch on the tv, I need to try Atleast 10 times. And if it still does not work, I need to manually switch on the tv by pressing the button behind TV. I really like the One Plus brand but, TV definitely is not up to the mark. Can't handle the lag sometimes. It's very frustrating after paying so much money and can't do anything when the remote does not work. I'm sure I definitely can use connect feature on my One Plus mobile phone as remote, but what's the TV remote for when it does not do what it is supposed to do."

One of the worst TV's I have ever seen. Avg display, Avg sound. Doesn't switch on as soon as I power on from the remote, need to press at least 2-3 times to switch on TV.  There's a lot of lag for volume buttons. Sometimes TV itself goes to home page from live TV and doesn't go back to live TV, need to switch off TV and switch it on again. After 1 month of usage TV hanged up a few times. The TV even doesn't connect to OnePlus connect app. Need to find TV on mobileapp for so much time, sometimes even after many trails I can't connect to my TV. Even opening and closing apps is very laaagggggyyyyy."

Contrary to the quality of the phones, the TV quailty has proven to be nightmare for me. On top of that their service is poor. The option to register complaint through Amazon gives no result. 1st the display was not proper, after complaining they took two months to change the display. The new display lasted only 10 days and now its completely black screen with few colored lines. Its been 10 days, I have raised complaint to both Amazon and One plus directly but all in vain. I will not recommended this TV to anyone. I have two more TVs at my home (both Samsung), never faced any such issue. Samsung has the same price and same features.

239,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Consider the trade-off involved before buying it,3.0,"Like the title of my review said, I am going to only list down the factual pros and cons after a day of using the TV elaborately and let you decide for yourself.Pros-Great picture quality, especially if content is in HD-The smart TV features that allows you to pair it with your phone, laptop, bluetooth speakers, bluetooth headphones, etc. are super handy-The screen size of 43"" is just perfect for your room unless it is ultra spaciousCons-The sound. 20W is loud enough, but the quality is really poor and one-dimensional so you will surely need an external sound system or sowaker-The finishing of the product is not the best. One can tell how OnePlus managed to price this at 25k when you pay attention to how they've cut corners on the quality. The OnePlus logo on the front is titled (first time I've ever seen this on a product from a reputed brand). There's a considerable gap between the display and top corner bezels, and the plastic finishing isn't even-There's a lag when you're operating the TV (switching between apps, browsing content, and giving Google assistant voice commands) 50% of the time. Hoping OnePlus fixes it with future software updates but so far there's no official word on thatThose are my pros and cons in a nutshell, now the decision is yours"

The processor isn't that powerful. I don't know how at the launch time the demos work so fine.Navigating between sources,apps, volume control is very laggy.Switching tv on is very tricky. Sometimes it takes 10+ button clicks to turn on tv.This issue is same with Mi TVs as well."

The screen keeps flickering or goes blank for 2-3seconds if connected to HDMI2. Tried with different devices in HDMI2 port to confirm the issue.I got the TV replaced. But the same error again persists even with the replacement TV.Hence, it's confirmed that there is some manufacturing deffect with this model of television."

248,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),A good product for the price range! But disappointed on Oneplus:(,3.0,"Reviewing after using the product for a month.*Picture quality is awesome. It will beat many other competitors in this price range but not that great as boasted in the launch event.*Sound Quality is average. But you have to make some changes in the settings to get a good sound output. But compared to Motorola and realme tv in this price range, it'll lose. In this TV to get a good sound output, you have to max the volume.*Software is the point where I got disappointed from one plus. I expected many things because it's a TV from Oneplus. The TV lags a little bit. Control from the TV remote takes 1-2 seconds for the TV to operate. I hope one plus gives a good proper update to clear this problem.*Ram is 1gb and the storage is 8gb out of which the available is 3.6gb. Motorola has 4.6gb of free space. So a little disappointment but it's a TV after all not a smartphone.* Input ports works fine and u won't get a 3.5mm port.*Opening an app takes some time which is a little irritating.*As said about the Oneplus connect app, it's not that hype what you saw during the launch event. One annoying thing is you have to open a oneplus connect app from the TV and then you can use it from your smartphone. Typing option is not available.* Sometimes the TV doesn't open YouTube. Have to restart the TV and then open YouTube.If Oneplus is seeing this Review I expect you to solve the software issue regarding the lag which annoys a lotOne more thing I couldn't connect Alexa to this TV.Also I couldn't connect Google remote.Overall it's a good budget TV. But it's not that buttery smooth. If the software issue is solved then this TV will be a great budget TV.I hope my review helps you."

As a manufacturer, OnePlus should ideally honour warranty replacements especially when the product is less than 24 hours old and faulty right out. If you're buying this, be warned that OnePlus support is super apathetic and you'll probably be left fending for yourself.TV is fine(ish) as a product, nothing exceptional. It's rife with software bugs and lags -- can't even download apps because they all get stuck on ""pending"". Go for an Amazon FireTV, a non-smart TV with a fire stick, an Apple TV, or just assemble one yourself - you'll have a better experience than with this garbage product and company."

Think twice before you purchase OnePlus T.V from Amazon,1.0,"The Product came faulty out of the box. Within two months of purchase there were visible lines and blacked out picture when connected to a set top box.So finally one day the product decided to quit with no picture but just RGB lines on display. See for the details in shared pic.Now coming to the service part. It's been almost 3months since I am trying to get it serviced or repaired by Amazon(product support agency). Well it is a new year now still no luck.The customer care executives are a bunch of fools with no remors of your problem. Their constant jab is wait for 48hrs problem will be resolved. They provide you with all sorts of misinformation regarding their product support. One told me it will be fulfilled by ONEPLUS,Honestly oneplus don't give a flying duck' about customer or later in product support. With multiple calls and false promises, I called back Amazon Cs, this is when I came to know the product and service will be done by Amazon. Anyway after multiple calls and escalations till date no one visited. An engineer was scheduled to visit while he didn't and contacted me via call and asked me to click picture of the problem and send me via whatsapp. After looking upon it he told me it's a manufacturing defect and will be replaced at the earliest. Well later received a mail from Amazon stating support has been cancelled.So the moral of the story is,THE STRUGGLE IS REAL.Purchase One plus at your own risk.Don't trust Amazon for any service related query."

Sound quality require some improvement. Easy to connect with app. Very good installation service.Lots of one start in review are due to not getting Alexa offer and faulty products and installation service.Regarding Alexa they mentioned it's free or on less price but as there routine offer it's not kept easily available u have to check and add offer in u r cart which is not expected from amazon. It heart's if you buy product and not got offered Alexa. So my sincere request to amazon if u are willing to give any offer keep it easy and don't hide it. Else didn't give what we are getting in this price One ➕ Tv we are happy.Thanks

   I bought OnePlus 32 Y series smart TV on 16 Sep 2020 and during the initial usage I felt like this was the best grab for the price because Oneplus gives its superior build quality and smart features and everything seems to be fine for first 2 months.Literally everything was good .But after two months of usage the TV suddenly started showing display issues , such as change in colour , flickering etc and this issue disappears when the TV is  RESTARTED . Again this issue started appearing on random basis and goes when restarted.So when this happened multiple times I myself recorded a video and pictures  of the same and contacted amazon for the service.Believe me this is where it all started to become worser. The technician visited my home and confirmed it that the TV is having manufacturing defect as it doesn't have any physical damage.From then it almost took 2 months of continued followup with amazon customer care to solve my issue. The issue was escalated multiple time and still was not resolved. I talked with superior associate still they also couldn't solve my issue ,at last after multiple complaints and escalation on priority basis and to management level , they had to accept the return as an exception.OnePlus brand didn't meet the expectations in its TV."

I considered this TV just for the brand value and trust i had on OnePlus since i own a oneplus phone. But OnePlus disappointed me.Pros:1. Cost2. Picture quality for this cost (720p)3. Android osCons:1. Sound quality- not good enough. Even 100% volume sounds like a 20%. Watching the same content on a OnePlus 5 was louder.2. Display looked flimsy and was not firmly attached to the frame.

Seems a software problem which led to random loss if signals on the hdmi port 2. Apparently, this is an issue in multiple sets. Finally the problem was solved after a s/w update. But now, any time tv is turned on it automatically switches off and has to be turned on again. Started after the latest software update. Host of other problems as well. Whenever media is played from usb, the tv goes into sleep mode and stops after 10-15minutes. This is despite disabling the sleep timer and other power save options as well. Truly ridiculous product with stupid problems even if you consider the price range. Between this and the phone started to realise OnePlus is just big hype. Products are sub-standard."

   This TV is not great or not worst.I liked the picture quality in this range and bezel less view is awesome.(attached picture)However, not having aux support is minus. Sound quality of TV is poor. Poor and loud sound doesn't help.And recently I've found a dead pixel on the screen, of which I've attached the picture. Technician came and checked it. Received an update saying waiting for warranty part. Will update how everything went once anything is done.Updating on 30/10/2020-> Received replacement part-> Received part was replaced to TV with original one-> Executive messed it up and TV is not showing true colors now. To say it is showing negative like colors-> Looking trust on amazon day by day.->Chatted with agent called Seizel who is stubborn and not at all listening.-> Rescheduled a service appointment.-> Will see what will happen and update here.Will not recommend this product strongly.

287,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"Good TV given the price, Sound and Speed could be better",4.0,"Like the TV overall. Good picture quality and software interface. I would recommend it. However, I feel the following could have been done differently:1. The sound quality isn't all that impressive. The speakers aren't loud enough. I'm using additional speakers with my TV.2. The processor used is quite slow. I see apps hanging at times which forces me to reboot the TV.3. The setup process wasn't very smooth. When I first started the TV, I couldn't install or update apps. I had to reset the TV to get the play store working.4. I can't find a way to boot the TV to the home screen. It directly boots to the live TV interface. I don't have cable or set-top box so this doesn't make sense to me. If there is a way, I haven't been able to find out how yet after searching a lot online.5. The base of the TV doesn't feel stable. One has to take a lot of care if one wants to move the TV.6. It's very inconvenient that the ports in the center especially because of point #5 if your TV is on the table. This makes it hard to access the ports. We have to move the TV to access the ports and #5 makes it difficult. The ports should have been placed on the side. Since USB is the port I'll be using the most, I got around the problem by purchasing a USB cable that I can access without moving the TV.I went for the 43in TV instead of the 55in one just because I don't have place to keep the larger 55in TV. If you have place for the 55in TV and if it fits into your budget, I would recommend going for that one. It would have been nice if OnePlus offered a 43in TV with all the 55in features for a slightly higher price than the current 43in TV."

290,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Worst service ever by OnePlus/Amazon,1.0,"Review update on 2/10/2020,I have contacted customer care several times, and still they haven't responded. Amazon customer care just says that they follow up the matter, but still I havnt received any updates regarding they matter, they just don't value people's money these people just wanna sell the product n don't wanna know elwhat happens after saleI have one plus mobile, so I thought that TV will be having the same quality, The tv is awesome but the service from OnePlus/Amazon is worst. Display n all is good but tv don't have any built in quality.. the main board of the Tv was damaged within one month of use and till now these Amazon/OnePlus people havnt done anything to get it replaced. It's your money so please don't invest in these items were they don't even bother to give a service"

292,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Will not suggest to purchase oneplus TV worst experience with oneplus and Amazon,1.0,"I had worst ever than worst experience with oneplus tv.1. Very low quality build material cheaper.2. Hanging, restarting problem when you switching between app.3. Google Assistant not working since I update the Android version.4.  Sound quality is the biggest setback, it sounds like a 3rd rate speaker and sound isn't balanced. There is no clarity in the sound, you won't be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen.5. Frame of TV isn't durable, it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute.6. Remote is very slow. It takes time and you have to proper focus infront of tv.Bad policy of amazon.Technician from oneplus visit to solve but failed, technician from amazon come two time for inspection failed to solve. they are not able to do anythingSo, I will not suggest to purchase oneplus TV a lot of problems."

Everytime restart (/Power on reset) takes the time to 27Jan2021 & 1:00PM. Because of this Google products aren't working unless I change the time settings manually to current date and time.So I strongly recommend to take opinion from other users too.Am planning to raise service request on this issue to Amazon.

296,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"No replacement, even if there is manufacturing defect.",1.0,"I have contacted Amazon multiple times and every time I get the same answer, there is no stock for replacement. I am clueless about what should be my next step.Extremely BAD after-sales services. worst.Better to get a TV from local store than such products."
297,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Value for Money,4.0,"Back in July 2020, OnePlus launched its budget TVs line up. I prebooked the TV on the launch day itself. After around two weeks, the TV went on flash sale for the first time. I received the TV after a week. I got the TV for around Rs.20,000. I prebooked the device for Rs 1000, which gave me two years extended warranty and Rs 1000 amazon cashback. Also, I got Amazon Echo Dot for free and a TV which I returned and got a refund for the same. It was a great deal, and so I decided to go for the OnePlus TV.With an excellent price tag, it comes with some exciting features like OnePlus Connect, Dolby Audio Enhancement, Oxygen Play, Chromecast, Google Assistant built-in and compatible with Amazon Alexa. I was very much excited to unbox and try the OnePlus TV. It also comes with Android 9.0. Unboxing the TV and attaching the table mount was an easy process. Also, setting up the device was very easy.Initial Impressions:When I first started the device, it was lagging a lot. However, there was already a software update available when I just started the device. I quickly updated the device, and the TV was still not working smooth enough. I think going 1 GB RAM is not enough. The picture quality is impressive, and the sound quality isn’t good at default settings. After tweaking the sound, it sounded terrific. Regarding connectivity, it was very smooth. The bezel-less design was the most attractive part of the TV.Design:The design is the most decisive point of the TV. It comes with a bezel-less display, an 88.5% screen to body ratio, and an enhanced viewing experience. It is slim from the back of the TV. Also, the ports are accessible quite easily. The table mount is also of decent quality, and there is a LED indicator in the bottom right corner of the TV. Overall, I loved the design and form factor of the TV.Rating: 4.5/5.Display:The display comes with a bunch of fancy features. It comes with a 1080p resolution and has DCI-P3 93% provides excellent colour reproduction. It uses Gamma Engine for picture enhancement and has features like Anti-Aliasing, Noise Reduction, Dynamic Contrast and colour space mapping. It also comes with various display tweaks such as sports mode, movie mode and many others. But I just tweaked them to get the best out of the TV. The default settings aren’t as good as expected. After tweaking, the colours and overall picture quality is soothing. Although, I think the 60fps doesn’t look smooth enough. It seems like 30-40 fps. To sum up, the display is excellent at this price point, although you need to tweak the settings to get the best out of the display.Rating: 4/5Sound:It comes with a 20W speaker output and also supports Dolby Audio Enhancement. The default sound settings aren’t sounding that great. After tweaking the audio settings, it works at its best. It is loud enough and no complaints apart from default settings.Rating: 4/5Connectivity:We get all the required connectivity options. It comes with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, Ethernet, RF Connection Input, HDMI Input, AV Input, Digital Audio Output and USB Ports. And the most legendary feature is the OnePlus Connect. We can control the TV entirely using a phone, take screenshots of the TV and save and share it. You can also control the TV actions such as volume, switch input, open apps, and turn off TV using Amazon Echo Dot. But there is an issue with the remote. TV won't power on-off-on the first attempt. It also doesn’t have a dedicated input switch button.Rating: 3/5Pros:1)  Awesome colour accuracy, DCI-P3 93% and beautiful display quality.2)  Great sound quality with features like Dolby Audio Enhancement, Dialogue Enhancer, Dolby Surround etc3)  OnePlus Connect App features like taking TV Screenshots, controlling TV etc.4)  Aggressive price point.5)  Amazon Echo Dot integration and Google Assistant Built-In.6)  Bezel-Less display enhances the viewing experience.Cons:1)  It lags a lot at times and especially after turning on the TV from sleep mode.2)  TV won't power on the first attempt 90% of the times.3)  Default Audio and Display Settings aren’t the best.4)  1 GB RAM isn’t enough for the TV.5)  No Wall Mount inside the box.6)  No input switch button on the remote."

305,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"Good for price, but have space for improvements.",4.0,"It does have a really good picture quality and the sound is also satisfactory. Voice recognition works well and smart features are good. But there are so many bugs in the software causing Youtube and Prime Video to not work properly. I don't know if it's the CPU or the RAM it's super slow and hangs for like minutes which will only get fixed if we pull the power line. Not having an RCA or 3.5mm output is bad. And most importantly, Alexa never works in the TV. The TV turns off and disconnect from the Wi-Fi causing Alexa unable to control it. Plenty of bugs in that sector and seriously disappointed with OnePlus coming up with such a product. But considering the price range, it's good. Still can be improved way better."

   I think this is great Android TV. I got this @14999. It is definitely worth the money. I am reviewing this product after using it for 10 days. One thing that really annoyed me is that I got this for 14999 and a week after the price dropped to 13999. I know it's not a big deal but 1000 rupees is a big amount and I could have saved it.I will mention some pros and cons of product below and this might help you to make up your mind before you decide to purchase the product.Positive points:1. Picture Quality - The picture quality is superb at this price range.. It looks great, the colours are very bright and the contrast ratio of TV is also very good. The viewing angles on TV are also nice. I have uploaded a video regarding it, you can check it out.2. Smart cum Android TV - This is not just a Smart TV but it is an Android TV. This means you can install and sideload any apps you like as per your liking. I sideloaded a couple of apps and they all worked in first attempt. Earlier I was looking to go for Samsung and LG but both those TV in this price range only offers smart TV features and you can't side load apps in a Smart TV. That's why Android TV is best.3. Attractive Looks - One of the main reason why I bought One plus TV was because of the reason how good it looks. It almost looks like a bezel less display because the bezels on TV are super thin and sleek. The TV surely looks very attractive and it this price range you won't find many TV's as good looking as this.4. Operating system - The OS provided by one plus along with this TV is very smooth and it looks very clean and runs smooth most of the times. You might notice a little bit of lag while opening heavy application but it is hardly noticeable. In this price you can't really ask for much as TV only comes with 1GB of ram and despite that TV runs pretty smooth.5. Connectivity - Connectivity is smooth and fluid. I connected my Xbox controller to play some games via Steamlink and my Bluetooth controller was detected as soon I plugged it in. WiFi also connects within 5 seconds of booting the TV. The boot time of TV is also decent enough and only takes 15-20 seconds for TV to boot.Negative Points:1. Sound - The sound quality of the TV is fine. It is nothing special and not bad either. The sound quality is little above average. I think it could have been a little better.2. Price - Price drop pissed me off 😂😂. I mean come on I paid 1000 extra and one week later the price dropped, that's unfair. The TV is worth at 15k too but it could have been a classic deal if I got this at 14k! 😂3. Mirror Cast - Mirror casting from phone has a lot of delay even though I have a very fast network.All in all this TV is really good and I loved it.Important Info - You will be charged 299 rupees at time of installation of TV if you want to get the TV mounted on wall. The installation will be done at time of delivery and will be done by same people who deliver the TV. The delivery person will call you and inform you regarding the same. For 32 inches they will charge 299 and for above 32 inches you will be charged 399. My installation went very smooth and at first TV was not mounted properly so I requested person to put that in perfect position and he gladly did that for me. Overall I am satisfied with both the product and installation."
307,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Good at this price,4.0,"I am using this product for the last 2 months, over it is goodPicture Quality - Good, can it be betterSound - GoodSmart Feature - Average, voice recognization, and some other features are not working as expected.Remote Control - Very Bad, If you like to use a remote you need to be very close to the TV minimum 1Ft which is not expected. For a smart tv smart remote is a very important accessory without the remote you can't do anything.Build Quality - Average, It's could be better."
308,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),HD not good infront of samsung,1.0,"After delivered my one plus led tv On 31.10.2021 I Just purchase tata sky new d2h conection with HD pack and after installation as well as activation of HD PACK then same saw HD channel picture quality is vvvv bad dont buy for HD picture but SD picture not bad. Finally HD Users go to samsung, LG and videocon better than one plus 32inch pl.........thank for read."
309,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),The smartest TV with the dumbest remote,2.0,It's a marvellous Smart TV and extremely satisfactory features true to the OnePlus brand. But the biggest let down is the remote. It's a really crude piece of plastic with jutting keys that are too cluttered closely and get activated at the slightest pressure. There is no luminous keys and contouring is really a big let down. It is a nuisance to use the remote and a very big disappointment.
310,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Sound and Sytem Software is Pathetic.,3.0,I am writing this review after using this tv for 5 months and I received two updates in 5 months. Tv picture quality is amazing you get the best viewing experience but sound and it's android is pathetic. From starting I see lags in this TV and I thought it get resolved after updates but it's not resolved yet. Syetem interface is really slow. If you're planning to buy this tv go for upper one plus TV not this one.

312,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Most worst product of 1+ from amazon and worst CC with worst service,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   This is after 1 week of usage watch attached video, After speaking to Amazon Customer care they have assigned some Amazon service agent. The agent said he will fix the issue but even after 2 months there is no resolution to my issue. Never expected such a worst service from Amazon purchase. Even after reaching to 1+ CC, they said they will sendsome technician, but till now after 20 days no one reached. I request who ever see this review never ever purchase from Amazon site & 1+ products.I'll give -5 rating"
313,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Defective product & Amazon NOT providing Warrenty claim,1.0,"TV screen is defective after using 6 months. And Amazon is not providing warrenty claim for the TV. Upon raising service request, Amazon mark it completed without any technician. I suggest not to buy this product from Amazon because you will not get any warrenty claim if product is defective. One year warranty claim is fake, Amazon is not providing any warrenty claim. Don't buy from Amazon."
314,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Value for money,5.0,Tv is absolutely value proposition. All required features are in the tv. If you have a one plus phone then its a quick sync for first time installation.Dislike- does not come with a wall mount stand & the hd cable requirement is a 2.0 cable... These offset you by an additional amount depending on what you add on..Also you need to proactively call the installation guys as they were not aware of my installation job...
315,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Feedback on oneplus TV,1.0,Guys please don't buy oneplus TV and it's not a good product. We bought a new TV(3 Months old) and now it's not working now. I have called the support and written back and forth emails but no support. It's a worst support which I have never seen till today. Go for the MI or Samsung.
316,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Did not live upto the Brand's name. Don't buy it,1.0,User interface is good. Sound quality is poor. Have to use external speakers for clear sound. Better options are available in this price range.Edit: After using the TV for 4 months. I have downgraded my rating form two to one star. Bluetooth connectivity is very poor. You get delayed response. The screen has started bleeding. Already have a bright line on the screen which is spreading with each passing day. Worst TV in this budget. Don't buy it. Go for other options.
317,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"BAD PRODUCT, PATHETIC SERVICE.",1.0,"NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.I bought this product in October and the installation date given was 1 month later. Yet the technician had no mood to install it. Further, the Television worked fine for 3 months and one fine day its screen display went dark. We thought it was a Tata sky set talk box issue but later the other hdmi slot also went dark... I have been calling amazon every single day to provide a warranty repair... but for the past fifteen days they are not able to arrange a technician to visit us. I'm fed up calling and explaining the issue again and again. I'm now looking for a refund r else i will be forced to go to the consumer forum."
318,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Remote Control Not Working...,1.0,"Total Waste of money. Got the tv in flash sale and in only 1 month remote control stopped working. Asked for technical support, the Amazon guy came for inspection and found the remote control faulty and told that it will get replaced but did not get any replacement till date.  Neither Amazon is responding properly neither one plus is responding. Will suggest buying some other product from a local vendor to get support on an immediate basis."
319,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Didn't expect this from OnePlus,1.0,Picture quality is good.

320,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),No service available,1.0,Bought the TV on 17th October 2020. Tv was not working by September 2021 and made a warranty claim at Amazon. They lagged it till December 4th and said they can't provide warranty claim and the manufacturer has to provide.. OnePlus declined to provide warranty saying the warranty period was over.. I blame both Amazon and OnePlus for such pathetic service to their customers.

Then he plugged in the tv, holding in hand and said it turns on and was about to leave. I asked to put the tv on stand and then switch it on. He asked for OTP again and entered itThis meant delivery was done. Then i started looking at the picture and he left, i did'nt like the quality its grainy, lags a lot. I call Amazon and turns out my tv sale was final and not eligible for refund.Must have been written in fine print, why didn't the delivery boy explain this to me. I feel cheated with a TV i don't think i'll be able to use."

   Really had a nice viewing experience. Delivery was delayed a bit. Shipped through Delhivery Courier service.Myself installed the TV though the technician is scheduled.One plus doesn't provide any wall mounting brackets.TV is light weight.Sound quality is superb good.Video quality perfect at this price range.As I have checked the reviews I saw that some of them have faced remote connectivity is very slow. But I have experienced a very good response with remote control.I didn't face any Network connectivity issue also.I was able to access the internet through mobile hotspot and was able to play 1080 pixel quality videos on youtube.While accessing the TV through One Plus connect app both the TV and mobike should be connected to same Wifi network. If we get a call it automatically mute the volume. It's a good option.Finally it's very easy to operate as it have original android.Without any second thought you can go for it."

Having problems with oneplus connect app. May be some usage guidelines will help.Remote operating: worst. I think this is one of main drawback of this product. We have to point the remote staight into the bottom of the tv other wise remote control os not working. I guess it's do with the ram.

The product is having service centres only in limited area. Never buy this TV."

329,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Satisfied...!,4.0,"I hardly write product reviews but the great experience with the product made me go for it.Writing this review after a use of 2 months. Excellent product fulfilling all the expectations. Picture and sound quality - I am more than happy with it. Nothing less than established brands. I initially was worried as I had not used or heard much about 1+ TV sets, but I am completely satisfied.Got it for 15.5k in offer period with exchange of my 9 years old 32'LED.Wall installion\feature settings was done at the time of delivery with no hassle.Cons:1. SD channels quality is distinguished over HD due to increased screen size. Streaming HD data gives theatre feel.2. Remote batteries come from local brand, do not last longer. I switched to Duracell in less than 2 months.Would strongly recommend to go for it.Note: Holding a fifth star to watch for the prolonged usage experience."

But the TV operation is slow after 4 months of use... I use prime, hotstar, Netflix switching between app and sometimes selecting movie is also slow. Worst part is you can not turn ON the TV simple in a push of a button.. sometimes you have to do tricks to turn on the TV. Happy with the sound and Picture quality please improve the above issues."

But service from Amazon is pathetic for fitting. They sale TV on exchange, takes away the old tv and delivers new one. Then they keep you waiting full day for TV fitting and when you call the service person, he says he doesn't have time. Call center says they cam resolve only in 48 hours. So 2 days you are left with no tv. We were left with no choice but to fit it ourselves. Will never recommend anyone buy tv and trust Amazon for installation and fitting services."

349,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),The Best Product in this Price Range,4.0,The best android TV in this price range especially the picture quality is the best. Sound is not that great but if you have dth connection which provides dolby sound like Tata Sky then this tv dolby feature works very well. All other options are almost the same in all andriod TV series and an extra feature is after updating the software there is a app called Oxygen Play which automatically saves data of our viewing content from different OTT platforms and helps us to resume whenever we want to continue watching. Display wise it's the best.

355,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Good quality nuder the price. Bad installation service.,4.0,Pros: Excellent picture quality. Voice quality is good but needs go to settings and do setup to genre you watching. I set it to sports for everything. I bought it in annual sale and it is nice prodct under this price.Cons: No bootup sound or beep when powered on or used remote so you have to press remote quite hard. Takes good 1-1.5minuts to boot up.Overall verdict - Satisfied with the picture quality and sound quality of product. Could use a notification sound to save my remote though.Amazon installation service is not great as they force you to purchase wall mount stand and charge the installation.  Also the TV was delivered on time but it sat there over the weekend as the installation person could only come after 2days. Moreover they void your warranty if you go for DIY installation or setup which is pretty easy to do. Strange from amazon.
356,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Software glitches need improvement,3.0,Picture and sound quality are good but occasional glitches with respect to frozen or slow response while content surfing. This needs tv to be restarted to make it smooth again. My mitv which is slightly cheaper works flawlessly in this aspect and OnePlus has a lot to improve via software update maybe
357,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Worst Service,1.0,"I wish I had read the review’s on oneplus official facebook page. 99% people are complaining about the service providing by one plus.Now let me share what happens with me:I bought this TV through amazon with amazon and one plus brand warranty. Now I am facing some issues with my TV. I called the amazon service to fix my tv and I called them many many times and no one visit at my home to fix the tv ( to let you know I am living in Delhi-NCR not himalayas) so when amazon is failed to do that they escalated my request to oneplus and now it’s more than a month I am still calling them to fix my tv and every time they said we escalated your request to related department kindly wait for 3 days to visit the technician, and after 3 days you called they again saying the same thing again and again. it’s really frustrating.So I SUGGEST DON’T GO WITH ONE PLUS TV"

Great performance 👌👌👌"
359,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Awesome 😎 tv,4.0,I am really afraid about purchasing the tv because of the negative reviews I have seenBut after I have bought the product I am so satisfied with it and I must not have bothered negative reviewsThe picture quality is good mines an SD CONNECTION It would be awesome with a HD connectionMany said the sound is bad but I don’t see it like that because at 20% of the sound everyone at my home in any room of the houseYou need the adjust the sound at sound settings for better sound with the Dolby given the sound is fascinatingIt is good budget tvBought it along with AlexaMine is a remote location but got the installation done right the next day after the item has been received
360,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Brilliant picture quality but better than average sound quality,5.0,"The tv is very good, the picture quality is outstanding for a tv in this price range. The sound is pretty good if you select the right setting but the default audio settings produce terrible sound but you can't expect much more with a tv in this range. I don't think you can find another tv with these qualities in this price range other than the Samsung TVs I guess. But trust me, play a 4k video and you'll be mind blown by the picture quality and colours even though it isn't a 4k tv."
361,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),OnePlus tv is not worth a buy. Technical Service is pathetic. wastage of time and money.,1.0,"I bought this product and it's 6month passed. tv accessories seems to have some malfunction( technically we don't know for sure) and technicians doesn't arrive at location to diagnose the actual reasons for the problem. Digicare reps won't call on your appointments timelines and kill your time and doesnt show up at location. Instead on various followups some un authorised person calls and make assumptions from the technical issues as per customer feed and they encourage you to buy a new accessories instead of actually checking the problem at the location. My experience with this OnePlus tv has been below average for the kind of picture quality, sound system and BT connection isues and other features are not so fascinating. i suggest fellow customers to buy another chepaer product with best installation and warranty claims but not this kind a item with such marketing strategies."
362,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Strongly recommend not to buy this one,1.0,"Very worst tv I have ever seen. Worst kind of support from one plus. Recommend not to buy this one. Bought this one on Dec 2020, after 2 months of usage screen flickering issue occurred, I try to claim warranty from one plus from march month till now. Raised many cases to one plus support team but there is no proper update. Every week they are telling new update. Now finally yesterday they said again like tech visit will be arranged, from Mar month I have received 3 tech visit. 2 month once I am getting tech visit but no proper resolution given for my problem.Now I called with amazon team and asked them to support  me. Now am going with amazon let me see whether one plus people take my concern now."
363,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Good TV,4.0,"Picture Quality is quite Amazing and I am fully satisfied with that picture quality. Gamma engine is one of the major plus point in this. Comming to Remote Control, it is some what average, even if we click on the buttons on the remote some times it will not function and sometimes when we we are watching channels in the set top box, it abruptly comes back to home UI inteface not sure why it is happening, may be it will be getting updates in further comming days. Now coming to sound, I didn't like the Sound much, when we are watching any TV channels which are connected through Set top box, it's Okay and when we are watching any movies in Netflix or Prime Video, Sound is totally disaster, even we can't hear the dialogues clearly. This is one thing that I was disappointed a lot. Now I must plan to buy a sound bar. If the TV sound quality is good, I may not buy this. This is the thing that OnePlus must definitely look into it. If you want good picture quality and you previously have a speaker/sound bar then you can blindly go to this. If you are not having any of the sound bars/speakers the choice will be of your own."

No base at all.>> Picture quality is not great.>> System is very slow and laggy.>> It lags a lot when I cast my phone.>> I can't cast my laptop onto it.

369,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Bang for the buck,4.0,"I’ve been using this TV for 3 weeks now and I’ve only used it with my WiFi connection. I’ll be brief in my review.1. For the amount you are spending, you will not be disappointed.2. Picture quality is good but at this price point. If you compare with TVs at a higher price point, you will be surely disappointed. Colours are bright but could have been better.3. Sound quality could certainly have been better. Don’t try to raise the volume too high or else the sound will break. It is  acceptable if you have a average size room say, 10’x10’ but anything larger than that and you will feel the inadequacies.4. There is a certain noticeable lag in operation but nothing you can’t live with. And you also get used to it.5. Again, I will say that the amount which you are spending, it serves the purpose.6. There are other brand TVs also at similar price but this was the latest model and hence I purchased it.7. I’m satisfied. Giving 4 stars and I don’t think that you can get a 5 star rating TV in this cost."
370,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Not the best buy,3.0,"To start with the weight is definitely light hence easy to install on a wall. Good decent picture quality for the money one spends on it. Can't expect clarity like expensive one on this. Now the down sides of this android TV.1. The sound quality is bad, dialogues can't be heard sometimes and you really have to crank up the volume to an irritable level.2. Remote is definitely not the most responsive of the lot. Each button needs to be pressed couple of times while pointing at the right direction for it to work.3. Speak function is worst. Absolutely non usableBuy only if you use your television seldomly."

   Don't buy this TV. Worst experience. Bought it only 4 months back when it was launched. But now the screen display is flickering and stuttering. The OnePlus service team is so poor that they could not even respond properly. Oneplus may be a good brand for high end mobiles but not for any other consumer goods. I just want some technician to arrive at my place to sort the issue out. No one is responding properly. Service team sets a bad example for OnePlus. Oneplus service team is not like for samsung or any other big brands. Their network is so small that they can't provide the service on time and in many areas."

Light weight and easy to use.It is so light that I have to go to the warehouse to pick that up because the delivery person says he can't come to deliver. And he was okay if I complain. I got the TV after almost 10 days when it had reached the warehouse. And the best part the delivery team were not even concerned about it. I just walked in after so much frustration and picked the tv and then I got a msg on my phone saying Your order is out for delivery. I hope Amazon does take some action.

The grey uniformity of the screen is really very bad (even worse than a lot of much cheaper TVs). The viewing angles are also the worst I have ever seen in a TV... The sound is very, very bad and I wouldn't recommend this TV to anyone. Despite the Android TV advantage, this TV is much worse compared to TV which cost half of this."

Upon a lot of convincing my Dad finally trusted a One Plus TV as he is traditionally a fan of Samsung, Panasonic and other ""established"" TV's. The One Plus TV not only has impressed him but the prompt installation and customer support has helped increase his faith in an otherwise ""new"" company. Coming to the TV the picture quality is amazing and the voice recognition along with Alexa works like a charm. Despite many negative reviews on the sound quality I found it satisfactory and absolutely upto the mark. I DONT NEED ANY EXTERNAL SPEAKERS as the sound quality is DAMN GOOD. Coupled with a good high speed Wifi this TV is a STEAL at this price. Other smart LED TV's are 10k expensive and with no other Notable increase in any features (as I have seen in many of my friends homes)."

I filed complaint to ONEPLUS first and Amazon then. The Technician never visited my home after his only first visit in NOV 2020. Always made false reporting, always rescheduling and cancelling visit appointments and even after then just updating ""waiting for parts"" I thank Amazon who accepted return of my television in January 2021 and till 9th March 2021 he was making false reporting; ultimately i told him about my return of television and he ended the service ...... I HAVE TO SURRENDER A GOOD TELEVISION (just a small defect) BECAUSE OF THE PATHETIC SERVICE.  Later I purchased Hisense 43A71F from FLIPKART with 3 years complete protection plan of flipkart ( my OnePlus tv also had a extended warranty/ protection policy) . I changed TV brand and purchase app just because of this service..... I hope this feedback will take some measures which will benefit your future customers!"

Picture quality is not so great.3. TV gets hang in all the applications.4. It'll go back to initial screen while you are watching something.5. Sometimes it works as radio you play some video but u can only hear it and entire screen will become blank 😑6.

Now I have wait for 25 days to technician to come and inspect.Brand value of ONEPLUS in mobile category is GOOD , When it comes to TV , ONEPLUS made a scarp product.

After 15 days their is a black line appear on the screen and after some hour whole screen became black and nothing can be seen on the screen. Now we can only hear the sound with this tv. Because it happens after 15 days so Amazon refused to give us replacement and suggest us to contact with OnePlus. Now OnePlus taking its own time to decide whether they will give me a new replacement or they will repair this crap. Don't know how much time they will take?

   Purchase this during Amazon sale for my room and it’s an excellent TV. Have been using it for more than a month now and there have been not any issues such.Pros:1. Amazing clarity2. Amazing sound for a small room3. Chrome cast or casting works neatly4. All the apps work extremely fine.5. The Bluetooth remote is extremely good and there is a knack to use this - it gets switched off due to inactivity so if you want to quickly turn on your TV you’ll have to press on the power on button twice with a gap of 3 to 4 seconds in between.Cons:1. There is a lag while starting the TV and some apps.2. Voice recognition take some time.Lags do happen because you’re paying not a big price for a TV like this which is feature loaded so I feel this is worth the Buy!"

The video gets stuck and a cracking noise plays !! Reported and scheduled a return within 2 hours from the time of delivery.After using onplus phone, I was extremely impressed and ordered the tv based on my experience. After reading all the reviews here, I feel Onplus should simply take this product off the shelves if they care about their brand value.6th May : return scheduled on 4th May. No news yet on the pickup. :(Money will be refunded only after they receive the product.8th May : i called and Amazon promised to initiate ""advance refund"" if the product is not collected within 72 hours.12th May : I called Amazon customer service is now saying that they cannot process ""advance refund"" until they recieve the product.This is un-ethical customer service from Amazon.

I was not able to use internet even after my internet was working good. after going through multiple blogs, i found that there is some date and time issue.I have again raised the complaint with oneplus support. Engineer visited and made factory reset and left.I have called engineer, the issue is not resolved. The engineer has closed the service request saying that there is a problem with motherboard please raise the request again.I have raised again with engineers feedback and support team has said that they have escalated the issue to manager and will receive the call back in 24-48 Hrs, I have waited for 1 Week and again called up, same thing they said you will receive the call back in 24-48 Hrs and this time i have waited around  2 Weeks and called to support for status surprisingly they have closed the issue without resolution. asked the support person with what comment they have closed but he was hiding something and said that i don't have access. again new issue request raised again.In short, Please don't buy One plus TV's and don't fall for wrong advertisements of Amazon and One plus.

I pre ordered it on the first day itself. But later I've realised that it was the biggest mistake. The OnePlus trademark of quality doesn't applicable on the this Y-Series. It feels like they have just put OnePlus logo on some cheap quality TV. I'm getting regular issues with the TV. If I claim for service the person comes and resets the TV and says everything it good and after 3-4 days same issue happens. 1st Issue: The screen went blank and only audio came without video. 2nd Issue: Video stuck and audio continues and remote doesn't work. 3rd Issue: Sometimes Remote doesn't work. 4th: There is some little gap in between the outside panel and the screen and when I showed it to the service person he says it is normal due to sensors present that gap is visible.but there is no sensor present in the middle. 5th: User interface sucks. 6th: Bluetooth connectivity issue. Multiple times I reported and the service person comes and resets the TV and leave.  7th: Connectivity b/w TV and remote is the worst. All the time the TV sucks. Do not go for it. If you want a 32"" TV in the budget go for MI or RealMe. OnePlus Y series is worst in the entire OnePlus lineup."

Initially thought Oneplus would not compromise on the quality part but then after seeing the quality of the picture and smart features, I have to certainly change my mind.

The producy delivered to me is a faulty one with defective display pannel.

The delivery person was good enough to install and provided the Demo with very much patience. TV was working fine for that Day.!The problem started the next day. Though my home WiFi is connected to the TV, it is not allowing YouTube to play and not allowing my mobile casting. I have restarted TV many times and in vain.Later, I have complained to Amazon and they arranged a technician to my home and he agreed that there is an issue with the TV and suggested having a replacement."

My last TV was ordered from Flipkart and prior to that from Reliance digital. In both cases the technician was assigned within 30 minutes post Delivery. Here I had to wait for another day for installation which means I lost 2 days. Technician called and told me that I will have to remove the old wall mountable bracket myself as if he does it, that will waste his time. I had to call my contractor as I did not have the tools.

This is the first time that I am really disappointed by Amazon and One plus but one time is enough. From now onwards Amazon will be the last resort to buy the things as well try to buy from showrooms or Flipkart. If something won't be available somewhere then only will do business with Amazon.After being a Loyal customer for 7 years never expected that Amazon will treat me like this.Thanks for screwing up things.

462,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),SO many BUGS with bad Software support(ignored product by OnePlus),2.0,"The main problem with it is not its speakers but the software support being given. Its software is very laggy and buggy with bugs which are never fixed. It might receive software updates but the bugs are still there every time. If you turn the tv off with remote, it turns on again on its own. Sometimes you have to press the power button several times to turn it on. If you switch between apps extensively it gets slowed down and lags till you restart it. Takes several seconds to power on.Overall, it has bad speakers and bad software. Display is good but you have to tweak it a bit because it is so saturated. So, spend some more money and don't buy this product."

First if you want to buy this item u should have prime membership first condition2. After becoming the ""prime member"" TV is delivered after seven days it's a joke from Amazon and it shows that  they don't take their prime members  seriously3. And I have to wait for 10 Freaking days for insatallation4. Then that insatallation guy really he is a fraud he charged me 800 rupees for wall mount and before coming for installation he asked  there is two wall mount one is local of 400 rupees and another one is from one plus of  800 rupees so I choose the 800 one which is from one plus which is doubt full.5. One plus should add wall mount barcket in the box so these fraud installation guy can't receive any one  after Amazon doesn't take the liability of this they said that this is  the genuine price and I  doubt it because he didn't bring the wall mount bracket in retail box and making excuse that he don't have enough space in his bag .6. This is  the first time I am  buying anything from Amazon and I buy disappointem not a tv  from Amazon again thanks Amazon for this shipment experience .7. Now for tv is ok picture quality is decent but sound is not that great it's loud but not clear .it could have been better connectivity is good just like everyone is saying that tv lags not in my case remote work superb no lags and everything else is ok"

Screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time.6. System lag is the maximum in this class of TV's"
544,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Not upto Expectations - slightly disapponited,3.0,Echo dot doesnt work with the TV as advertised and is awaiting a software update so buying an echodot as a bundled offer with the One Plus TV is not helping . The TVs picture quality can be a bit better and really not upto the Mark as it is advertised. The TV apps is a bit slow and hangs at times . The Remote functioning is not as agile comparing a VU or any typical brand . Overall not a pleasant experience and  not expected from One Plus. I have a feeling Oneplus is compromising on the quality at various ends .
545,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),GO FOR IT,5.0,Nice product at this price. Quality of picture is very nice. Has got all the smart features. Voice recognition is also good. For that make sure your internet is has good singnal. Sound quality is not good. For that you have to buy sound bar.

Issues with sound quality, but on customizing the sound from settings, the sound quality improves a lot. At this price point, it is quite good. If one is happy using YouTube, AmazonPrime, Netflix, which are pre installed, you are not going to face any issues of lag.Most importantly, found ""Made in India"" written on the back panel of the TV. So, one can prefer this product from other available at same price range."

   Never expected to write a negative review for OnePlus Product !1. Screen Flickering is the most common problem2. Half of the times, TV doesn't start with a single button press.3. Booting takes atleast 20 seconds4. Screen goes all the ways blank in middle of play time.5. Audio is dud - Not sufficient for my 10X10 ft bedroom6. System lag is the maximum in this class of TV'sEdit: 23/07/2020Amazon declined to replace and offered refund of 19,600/- as against 23k which I paid for the TV. All I have to do now is to live with a defective TV, as I had invested in the wallmount and the allied services. OnePlus SettledEdit: 27/07/2020Product is back in stock. Amazon accepted for replacement after technician report. But, defective product is yet to be picked up and the replacement is yet to be shipped. Awaiting further details. Brand is not at all acting in the customers interest. Very bad response for OnePlus.Edit: 6/8/2020Received the replacement TV from Amazon and the TV if working fine as of now. I installed it on the wall by myself. A bit of lag and sound issues, but the screen stuttering is gone."
2121,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Cinematic picture quality with low quality sound bar,4.0,"TV is beautiful with minute bezels.I was pleased by the picture quality in firstI expected a smooth software from oneplus but TV operation is bit slow probably due to 1gb ram and lower clocked processor. Can't complaint at this price point. Wish oneplus would release better optimized software in update. Software update was one of my reason to buy TV from oneplus.Response from the bluetooth remote was bit slow.But hold bluetooth was very functional. Might be as it is bluetooth 5.0, TV was able to connect to 3+ devices at a time. 1 mobile, 1 bluetooth speaker and remote. That's great.Coming to sound, Speaker quality isn't upto mark. You have multiple options to enhance audio (dolby, surround, presets, dialogue enhancer etc) probably that's the reason oneplus skipped 3.5mm output and opted for optical and HDMI ARC ports to provide quality auido output on external speaker. You should go RCA audio adapters if you want 3.5mm input else connect to speakers using bluetooth adapter. That would cost additional if you want to.If you look for picture quality, minimal design and stick to few ott app this TV is for you.For power users and those who use only 3.5 jack to connect speakers look else where.Update :Oneplus released major update and UI and remote control navigation seems improved now.But setup of new Bluetooth connection got buggy. Im not able to connect to new devices. It is looping back to searching devices after clicking on device after search list"
2122,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Y DIS Y series?,1.0,"ere is my experience with the Oneplus LAGGY tv32Y model. Here is a list of issues with your product.1. connected to Samsung mobile through google home as the tv isn't connecting through Samsung smart view. always says unable to connect, try again. And even through the google home, it is struggling too much to even cast the photos and forget about casting the videos.2. Neither windows nor Mac is recognising The tv in wireless mode. Had to use third party app from play store to Airplay my Mac n gues what, windows is not recognising the tv. It is really shocking to see Mac recognised where Windows couldn’t (using third party play store app).3. To my bad, even through third party play store app, it is laggy half of the times.4. And how can I ignore to say about Oneplus connect app, Its a wonders**t app, do the gesture wait for couple of seconds and then it responds and you can’t access files through the connect app on this tv.5. And sound, it has options by the name, dolby Audio and Dolby digital plus, fix this in your mind, these two features are just names and these does change the sound experience by zero percentage.6. On Youtube, video quality is limited to 1080p, best to use HDMi cable to your happy and play 4K, only then it felt better than any other video quality experience of this tv.7. Opening and closing apps, is like suspense thriller movie scene experience, you will be waiting to know when it will respond.sometimes suspense extends to 3-10 seconds.8. Viewing angles? acceptable for this price.9. Colors? Green is worst of all and then red , black is good, blue colors are worst, yellows are good and the rest that you find are acceptable.10. Display quality? If any of you ever used the Chinese phones of the last decade, you will get the exact same feeling. I promise you this.11. Best option to put  good use of display and colors is to use pen drive, hard disk or HDMI and play the 4k or full HD videos. This is the only way that this display can make you happy.12. And the remote, the menu button literally never worked on  any app nor on home page. It just exists with void function assigned to it.13. Almost forgot about voice search that is google assistance, 10 out of 10 times, it took 3-10 seconds to launch it.14. Opening an app, Fix in your mind that it will take at least 3-10.15. Once you connect Bluetooth accessory, you have to remove the device from the list, if you want to connect it to other device. you will not have an option to disconnect."
2123,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"Contrast Ratio, Viewing Angle, Colours, All Good.",5.0,"I will be brief here.Unboxing:No wall Mount.No Display cables.Plastic stands.Thin TV.Pros:Contrast Ratio is Amazing. Black level is amazing.Viewing angles r fine.Awesome Colour accuracy.Latest Android version.Cons:Poor quality Speakers.Little bit laggy, probably the OS.The panel is awesome, TV won’t lag when playing video, and it’s really okay, android phones have similar issues.As for speakers, why would you use inbuilt speakers?What matters most is Contrast Ratio, Colour range, viewing angles, and clarity.They r all good in this price range, no 20k-35k 43” FULL HD TV could do better.AMAZON INSTALLATION:I didn’t get the wall mount, cause installation guys were charging me for it!TV is good, Amazon Service is getting poorer."

2125,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),First to review Awesome TV with cherry on the cake.,5.0,"First to review 43y1, as my experience with 43 inch So far i liked the Tv.Tv is by default on energy saving picture mode, change to desire mode to get best picture experience, as i changed many picture settings the picture quality is way better than MI & realme me.Sound quality for my living room is more than enough, dolby atmos work carm with my Tatasky HD channels as they support dolby audio.The Lag is fixed to much extent.last input memory is also fixed, TV remembers the last input before switching off.The installation was bit crisp as the guy didn't turn on the promised date, so amazon escalated and yesterday new guy came and installated.Cherry on the cake the installation was free also the wall mount bracket worth Rs500 was provided free by the installation team.Installed and the demo was given very promptly.Also to be noted this 43 inches has different graphic processor than 32 inches G51 Mp3Updating my experience of 4 days -Experienced lag nly twice in 4 days.TV takes a approx of 1 min to get ON.There's a bit motion blur, which would be fixed by update, as it arises due to the DNR in the settings.Sound output is overall good at this range can't expect soundbar like bass.Pre-Book extended warranty has been activated and mail confirmation received from acko.Picture quality is just awesome, with setting proper backlight, contrast etc.Blacks are properly seen black.This has VA panel and i am not much concerned about viewing angles. VA Panels are best for the straight view angle as they produce good contrast and color reproduction,this TV does the same.Viewing angle can't be reviewed from my end as I did see blur when viewd at 150 angle which is obvious for VA panel.Data saver option and alexa support is yet to be updated in this TV.As of now no alexa support for this TV as there's no option to login to oneplus account, so my free echo dot is not of use with this TV as of now, may be they will provide the update to this.Updating my review with some test done1) RGB colour gamat test is performing perfectly on this TV. As you can see computer rgb reproduce proper color.2)motion blur is too much in this TV, expect to be fix via update.3) TV remote is Bluetooth and IR both, i turned of my bluetooth of Remote and using on IR as it's draining battery, when on IR you can't use Google assistant function.4) No support for Echo dot as of now confirmed, hopefully will be in update.5) No data saver option yet.6) backlight bleeding is present at 10% which is common for LED Tv.7) color reproduction is good too.Updating my review to some clarification and my experience 26/071) As echo dot is not compatible and no1 from oneplus has spoken about echo dot compatibility with Y series, i returned my echo dot for full refund.2)Those posting negative reviews due to echo dot not received, kindly add echo dot from cloudtail in cart with oneplus tv, u vll get it for free.3)Those posting negative reviews that after tv return oneplus gave nly 19965 rs, please return your echo dot too they remaining approx 3045rs will be refunded then only.4)I connected my JBl sound bar and watched movies on Prime , I bet the dolby atmos did its work 100%, and its natural u can't expect soundbar sound at 23k.5) pre-book cashback of 1000rs is credited to my amazon pay balance."
2126,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Worst TV ever. Don't buy,1.0,I got it delivered by 21 july. Shipping was good but then bright spots started showing from the next day. Product quality isn't good too. I advise you not to buy this oneplus TV's
2127,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Worthy in this budget segment TVs,3.0,"1. Picture quality is good. Look & Feel is good. I would quote ""Best in this segment TVs."" I have explored most of the well noted brands in this price segment.2. Sound is 3/5. With Dolby Digital Plus enabled, it is better.3. TV build quality is good, Viewing Angles are good too.4. 4K Videos will be reset to 1080p and this is the maximum resolution for any video.5. Only 4.6GB memory is available out of 8GB.6. Oxygen Play is useless.7. There is bloatware instead of oneplus clean software motto.8. Accessing Tv with Oneplus connect App is 1 out of 5. Its a disaster.9. Wall Mount is free. It will be brought by installation provider, do not shell extra bucks for wall mount or installation.10. Apps take ~10 sec to open, I am expecting optimization over next updates.11. USB Ports doesn't support FAT32 Memory sticks (Pendrive, Hard Disk, or Phone). I am disappointed for this one.12. Max viewing distance can be 8 feet. (My vision is 6/6 for both eyes)13. Though Google Play Store is given, you cannot install even google chrome. I see only Chinese apps are available even in google play store. Don't expect to install apps just like you do it on smart phone.14. No issue with remote and response time is good too. Remote build quality is good too.15. No heating issues noted so far.16. Supports only 2.4 Ghz band WiFi.17. No manual power switch. If remote doesn't work, it will be a hell with Tv.18. Chromecast has ~0.3 sec delay which is very bad if you connect with laptop and work with mouse/touch pad.Suggestion 1: If price is not a issue, go for Samsung or LG.Suggestion 2: Want to enjoy premium experience, buy premium Tv, do not expect to find it from Chinese brands. Time is money, the more time you spend in exploring the options and unboxing videos in YouTube, consider adding that amount to the TV you buy.Hope my review will be a help."

2132,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),A great product...!!!,5.0,"Was eagerly waiting for this Tv, it’s economically priced and I got it for 11.7k, super thin and lite weight..!! Thin Bezels and a absolute delight. Audio for a small room is great, bigger room it seems to be quiet less. Been using it whole day, just that one plus connect didn’t work with my iPhone and content from pendrive also not viewable at all, not sure if it’s supposed to be like that or there is some issue with the product.Called one plus customer care, who told One plus connect won't work for iOS, and suggested to long press the home button and select one plus server to connect android and to my surprise iOS also can get connected and works flawlessly.Moving on to the pen drive issue after a lot of research, trial and errors-It works only on the format FAT32."
2133,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),OnePlus offers superb product quality. Value for money.,4.0,The video quality is good but  sound quality is average with marginal noise on higher volume. I have viewed Online content and seen DTH tv they  gives true colors and you will truly love it.Dolby sound quality is enough even for living room . For DTH opt for a Dolby supported settop box. I am using airtel xtream box (4k)which is only 2249 for airtel thanks customer .SOFTWARE lags at times and when you select Live TV at times it will not start and gets back to homescreen. Was able to mirror cast through oneplus connect. OnePlus connect app helps to use mobile as remote after the initial update. The viewing angles are ok but this is VA panel so nothing like IPS panel. OnePlus has done good job with regards to video quality as it gives DCI P3 color gamut . Google assistant works fine too. The best thing is the customer service OnePlus offers which is top notch and they listen to you with patience. After sales matter and customer service matter alot in this era. Overall worthy contender.
2134,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),A Blot in the name of One Plus,1.0,"Bought during first sale on 5th July.This TV is a blot on the name of One Plus, they shouldn't have launched any product with such poor quality.Picture quality is very poor, colors doesn't look natural at all, tried all the color settings. May be good for a monitor but not definitely good as a TV.Sound quality is the biggest setback, it sounds like a 3rd rate speaker and sound isn't balanced. There is no clarity in the sound, you won't be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen.Frame of TV isn't durable, it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute.Summary: Don't expect anything good from this TV, this product doesn't deserve the One Plus brand name. One Plus should recall this product to maintain their brand image.I would have returned this product if there was an option."
2135,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"Dont buy,Worst tv with bad display and sound disturbance",1.0,"Oneplus is settled for this cheap built quality,it comes with plastic body,screen is not at all good,if you pressure you can see liquid like flowing which we see in cheap quality products,sound is too worst,in an olden days when you full the volume you can get bad sound with disturbance now you can experience same with this tv"
2136,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Value for money.,5.0,"Ordered on 18th and got it by 20th Afternoon, here's an honest review.But before that, here's a few tips for people who are going to buy it.You'll get an Echo Dot only if you order it with the tv at the same time, read the terms and conditions before leaving one star reviews because you didn't order the echo dot from your end and obviously didn't get it with the TV.To use the One Plus Connect app, you have to update the TV first, the OTA will be there when you turn on the TV for the first time.After that, open the connect server app on the TV, and then open the Connect app on the phone and it would work.Again, do a little research before leaving negative reviews and confusing the potential buyers.The type sync function(use the phone to type on the tv through the Connect App) doesn't work as of now, but would start working in the next app update. Head over to the community forum for the one plus tv to find more details.If you talk about hardware, the TV is flawless, those who are complaining about the TV simply have a bigger room that the TV is designed for. You can always buy a soundbar if you think the volume isn't sufficient for your room. For me, it's more than enough.The display is top notch and the colors are vibrant. It's truly bezel-less and looks beautiful.About the software, there are a few misses here and there, but I'm sure it can be fixed through a software update.ScreenCast lags a lot, I'm waiting for an update to see if it's fixed.To people who think that the TV lags a lot, think of the TV as a phone with 1 GB RAM, if you keep opening apps repeatedly in a short period of time, the phone would lag, same is the case with the TV.It's a value for money for those who don't wanna spend a fortune to get a TV with a good display."
2137,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Amazon failed to give me my Echo Dot which was supposed to be delivered at no charge.,4.0,"Firstly I did not receive my Amazon Echo Dot at no cost as promised.So I'm really pissed off however I liked the tv, good in quality and sound is pretty loud too.It's absolutely slim and sleek.Beautifully designed.Kudos to designed team.Easy to browse through apps and quick and easy to connect to phone especially one plus phones.Screen cast is just a click away.Gotta do some more research on One Connect App.It's giving me some hard time to connect to the TV."
2138,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),A Perfect TV For Casual Users Who Simply Want To Enjoy Content,5.0,"I bought this TV in the first sale on 5th July and have been loving it. Amazon installation was prompt and it was set up the same day as the delivery. It is pretty light and slim, as given in the specs.The picture quality is fabulous, colors are right and everything about the display is better than normal. As a normal user, you wouldn't notice any point of complaint regards to display.Speakers are loud enough, and we are bound to mostly use it at 25% of the maximum volume. Dolby surrounds sound is an added benefit that does enhance the sound experience of the TV.It runs Android 9.0 out of the box with Oxygen Play as the skin and the UI is pretty simple. It automatically fetches major information from the apps that you add to the home screen given you have signed in if required. The animations and transitions between application is sleek and there is no lag whatsoever. If you have used an android phone, the UI is no alien and the navigation will seem very familiar.The connectivity ports provided are ample and the WiFi reception is also pretty strong. I don't know about the bells and whistles that other TVs come equipped with, but as a normal user who wants to enjoy his shows, videos, and cinema on a smart TV from all the contemporary sources like prime video, Netflix, youtube, etc., this is the perfect option."

But amazon rejected REPLACEMENT Saying item is not available and informed me to issue refund for an amount of 19961 For the tv where actually i paid rs 22999  for the order. They said echo dot is FREE with this product when bought together on the first sale, but they adjusted 3k to echo dot even they said its for free if bought together. And even after 10 days and 2 sales over after that. They are still saying that replacement is not available . Clear case of cheating .

The remote becomes non responsive after some time of inactivity and it starts working only after a good 5-10 mins. Adding to this, the Oneplus customer support is even poor!

2147,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Go for other products,2.0,"Maybe because of the high expectations I had, hence my greater disappointment. It's an OK panel at best nothing too mind blowing. System lag is definitely noticeable and the picture is slightly oversaturated.But of course this is a budget TV and if you go for more expensive models of Sony, Samsung and LG you will have a better viewing experience. Everything else is fine. SUBPAR at best.Save up a little more if you can and go for more premium brands. Taste is subjective and if you're on a budget this wouldn't be the worst option either."

The noise disturbance is way too much. Color options are very limited and way too saturated. Also, they did not provide any echo dot even though it was written that it would be offered free of cost along with OnePlus 43y1. Neither at the time of purchase they mentioned about it (later they added the process). Read everything before making a purchase of this disappointment."

   No doubt TV is value for money but has few small issues.1. It doesn't gets on with single press of power button on remote.2. It is a bit slow because of 1GB RAM.3. Sound quality is not a expected.Few people mentioned about not receiving free echo dot. I got it for free just you need to add it to cart with TV and at checkout they will give a full discount for echo dot."
2152,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Amazing TV at this price range.,5.0,Display quality is top notch. Even though it's FHD. And for the sound quality. I also had issue with it. But first go in sound setting and turn on surround sound and dolby sound. And then feel the real sound this TV can provide. Earlier i had an issue with TV not being able to turn on by remote. But after reading the manual i cane to know that to turn on TV it uses IR blaster on remote like old days unlike bluetooth. So u have to point it directly to the right bottom of the TV. A splendid purchase for the price. Really happy. And the display is really punchy and colour accurate.

Good job by the Amazon delivery in Kollam (Kerala).The product is really worth the money you spend. All features mentioned work. You just have to update it first. ""Picture quality"" is excellent. Chromecast (Screencast) works fine. OnePlus Connect works (you have to follow the instructions in the app). All apps are working fine( Hotstar, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Netflix).You can connect the Echo Dot to this Television and it works perfectly fine.""Sound quality"" is more than average compared to the negative reviews that have been mentioned.

2163,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Budget king good build quality but pay 750 for wallmount installation,1.0,"Build quality is superb for this price range. Pic quality is similar to full HD there is no much difference like HD ready. Utube n other online streaming content clarity is good. There is no data saving alert. This can be used as a secondary bedroom TV. Sound is okay, u can connect it with external speakers. Little lag while moving through apps but that's not an big issue, jus give sometime to load. We r dealing with 1gb ram and budget processor. Wall mount for this TV is not included. Better u itself buy wall mount stand in local, wall mount cost me 750rs for a 13k TV. Amazon please set a standard price for installation and let it be visible for us while ordering. Really frustrated by receiving a cheap local made wall mount for 750rs from the installater. Initially my wallmount amount was refunded by the technician, now he got it back after a month. The happy purchase of mine is now turned horrible.

2166,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE RANGE - STILL AWAITING MINOR IMPROVEMENTS,5.0,"REVIEW # 1The launched was much awaited for & as soon as the sale for 43inch was out - we booked the TV. The addition of the Amazon Echo Dot was the Cherry on top of the Cake :-) The TV arrived the next day in Good Condition.OBSERVATIONS>> For this price - the TV has an elegant look. The Bezeless Display does indeed live up-to its mark. As per my calculations which includes the bottom logo bar as well - the display screen amounts to 89.74% of the total display.>> Image quality is indeed Amazing. The colours are vibrant. Images truly standout when fed with a 1080p input. The display does pure justice to 4K YouTube videos.>> Audio quality for this price segment yields no complaints. However, You will need a Sound Bar or Home Theater System if You want to enjoy the Video with Bass powered Sound. The TV promises Dolby Audio - but lacks Bass (obviously due to Sound Physics as it does not have a woofer) But still satisfies for a medium sized living room.>> Inputs are adequate taking into consideration the present technological advancements. 2 HDMI inputs for Your STB & Gaming Console. However a 3rd HDMI would have been great to have as spare to connect to a laptop (No really needed though as the TV comes with built-in Chromecast for Screen Mirroring)>> I would rate the OS response 4.25 out 5 as there is some minor lag when using the OS. When I received the TV, I installed the 823Mb update (dated 17Jun) but I believe there should be another update which should improve the OS Performance and fix some bugs within. A bug being the OS is unable to handle a Non-ARC HDMI device well. I enabled the HDMI-ARC service not knowing that my STB does not support ARC. Due to this there is a Blue rotating loading Circle constantly turning on my display when on HDMI input. Of-course disabling this service gets rid of the Blue Circle (But for OnePlus it would be nice to see a popup stating that the input device does not support ARC rather than have a constant Blue Circle on the Screen). Also, my OS still does not have the Data Saver feature which many users have stated that they do not see on their TV's. So anxiously waiting for the next OTA Update.>> As many users are raised the issue - Heavy Lag while using Screen Cast/Mirroring. Hoping again then the OTA update would fix this.>> TV Remote functions purely on Bluetooth. The Remote is compact & has a minimalist design. The best part being the remote has 3 dedicated buttons for OTT apps (Netflix, Prime & YouTube). A drawback I see in the remote is due to it being purely Bluetooth - I no longer can use my Universal Remote for my TV. Also I believe there is a bug in the remote which does not let You switch on the TV instantly (sometimes You have the press the Power button a few times - clearly visible on the red flashing led on the remote) Hoping OTA will fix this issue too. Another issue (my suggestion) with the remote is that it misses the Input Source Button. This missing button makes it extremely difficult for my not so technologically advanced Mother to switch between inputs.>> Another thing that surprises me is that there is a Dedicated Amazon Prime Video Button on my Remote but NO inbuilt Alexa integration. I have to use a Skill on Alexa but unfortunately like many other people I haven't been able to connect my OnePlus TV to my Alexa Account. This makes the supplied Echo Dot 50% useless as I cannot use the Echo Dot to wake up my TV via voice command. Yet to try Google Assistant (but I want Alexa functioning as my other devices are synced with Alexa) If You are reading this point and have been able to Integrate Your OnePlus TV to your Amazon Account - then Please leave me an Answer on my Question.>> The last point being - I am not sure if its a design flaw or a shipping mishap - But the TopLeft & TopRight corners seem to be either damaged or poorly finished by the Assembly Team. (See Images)Overall - this Product has so far satisfied me well. I will certainly be writing another Review when I have the OTA Update to fix some of the Bugs & Add the Missing Features. Until then I will enjoy my OnePlus TV :-)Lastly, 5 Stars to Amazon for providing the option of 2Year Extended Warranty for INR1000 and automatically adding it to my OnePlus after 3 days of arrival. In addition, just as promised returing me the INR1000 back as Amazon Pay Balance. Such offers keep customers like Me Happy."

2179,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Best Budget TV,5.0,The video and sound quality are awesome. you will truly love it. Dolby sound quality is enough to even for the living room. For DTH opt for a Dolby supported set-top box. Software optimization is top-notch. Was able to mirror cast.

OnePlus has done a good job with regards to video quality as it gives DCI P3 color gamut and feels of Full HD tv. Google assistant works fine too. The best thing is the customer service OnePlus offers which is top-notch and they listen to you with patience. After-sales matter and customer service matter a lot in this era. Overall satisfied.

   Just after 9 day of use screen started to flicker, which at first I thought might be connection issue or just a passing thing. But by the next day, you can see the reference video. And by all this time showing faith on the brand got me into trouble, as 10 days were done now.Then, the real game started. I got to taste the real service by customer support.haha.. It all started with simple sweet talk, no problem sir.. we will get it done attitude. Then came I have to talk to my executive, then, there is a form to be filled out and you will get a revert.Then, passing it to the so called concerned team.and then they were like we need a technician to visit and see what's the problem ( as if video was not enough, still ok).Then came the game of passing the responsibility. Amazon's technician ---> talk to amazon and they will send in the replacement,Amazon---> we don't have authority to give a replacement, oneplus needs to do it.. talk to their support.andthen oneplus doing the same stuff on repeat mode.. no response to email, even after 11 days.Had to wait for chat for 1hr, to talk to esteemed oneplus chat service. Again some sweet talk, will revert to you in 24hrs.Then, called oneplus and they again said amazon will do we can't..Great service and great companies..Update: 06/11/2020Yet to get a solution!! hahaha.. getting mad laughing!!"

2235,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Good for the price.,5.0,"Overall it's a good TV for the price. I got the 43"" TV , echo dot and 3 years of warranty.I did find it a bit laggg initially, but seemed better after the first update. The wall mount took an additional ₹800."
2236,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Best choice for 13k,5.0,"Like this tv very much. Better picture quality, good sound and connection.

Also i cannot control the volume of the tv in the settop box using settop box remote on Dolby mode
2240,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Woww factor for brand name,5.0,"I purchased this only for the brand name. You get a woww factor when you say you have one plus Tv.Other than that it is pretty normal TV for this price range. You get cheaper (1-2k) Tv from Thompson, Mi and VU for this price range. So you are actually paying 1k for this brand value and nothing else as the specs and performance match with other Tv brands.Display quality is very good and sound could have been better, these are on par with other TV on this same price range. Down firing speakers make sound little muffled.Casting works perfectly in both android and iPhone. Airtel Xrteam or jio live tv app is not available for any TV models but you can run it on phone and cast it to TV. So you don’t have to purchase a DTH or cable with smart TV with built in chromecast.TV does become slow when you open multiple apps but this is problem in all budget Tv models.2 hdmi ports is not a problem at all. As mostly you would only use 2 ports. 1 for dth and 1 for playstation. Since moving to OTT we no more use DVD or blue ray players. Also chromecast is inbuilt, so there is really no need for 3rd hdmi cable."

2252,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),One plus TV a big LET DOWN :(,2.0,Expected a lot... but basic things not functioning1.

2254,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),A strict No-No. Worst product by OnePlus,1.0,"Had an extremely poor experience with OnePlus TV.TV screen turns black on random occasions but frequently, it again turns back on in 30sec to 5 min.Sounds stops working similarly.Picture turns green randomly.This doesn't feel like a OnePlus product. Even local brands provide better products.After all this, i applied for replacement and then amazon scheduled an inspection service and the inspection guy didn't show up. Had to rescheduled it two more times but no one shows up. Contacted amazon and told the whole scenario then they replaced it directly.Got the replaced product but the issues are still there and this time the product feels like second hand. Only that this time the issues ka worse and more frequent that last one.Filed a return request, again got inpection service scheduled and after explaining previous experience to customer care, this time got a call from inspection guy. He made a video of the issue. He said that he has verified the issue but I did not receive any response from Amazon regarding this.And the worse thing, Amazon is not providing customer care support now. Tried multiple times but didn't recieve any call from Amazon. Feeling stuck with this defective product.Won't be using Amazon for a long time now.Update: After initiating the return order again, Amazon sent people for picking up the defective item. Now waiting for refund initiation."

   It's awesome tv at 13k, except for viewing angles.It's color production and lookwise it's unmatchable.From front on it matches any full HD TV, interface is smooth.Color production is really good, blacks are really black like OLED panelFrom sides it's colors fade is noticable, it's the only but big negative from OnePlusWhen it comes to sound it is good while streaming through apps like YouTube, hotstar,, with set of box it's bit low.No lag in OS, remote is easy to operate and premium look.After 6 months usage , it's going great and really satisfiedAfter almost 1 year usage I'm satisfied with this TV , picture quality is of high class, one issue noticeable is there is a 3 mm gap at the base frame, not a major concern but OnePlus need to take care.If you are using it only with set of box use a good hdmi cable , it will really enhances viewing experience. With AV cables you will get very poor picture quality.It's one year of moderate use , but I'm getting back light issues on screen, currently it's not a issue while watching , but if it continues to intensity it will be a issue, I didn't expect that within a year."

   Respected viewer,I know before purchasing this expensive leisure you will be viewing the rewievs let me tell you this TV has a great picture quality and smart features but this crashed in just 3 days of use . I purchased this TV long time back and it was kept in one corner of my house and then after a hell lot of scams one fine day a totally unprofessional fellow came to install it ...... After damaging the whole wall with innumerable drills he installed it and didn't even explain the features which , somehow , we got to know about.....then he charged the double price for the wall mount.....then after thousands of complaints finally we got a refund. Would suggest to buy from a showroom. Hope you find it helpful but informally would like to tell if you don't want to fall in any sort of problem .... Then please don't purchase this product !Have a good day"

2275,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"Smart TV which isn't that ""smart""",3.0,"If you're going to purchase this product make sure you have atleast 4gb / day data plan dedicated to this TV.Also you need a WiFi router for getting full functionality.Let me start with the pros1. Picture quality is great. You'll need some Tweeks though. Set it on movie preset for day time use. Energy saving for night time use. I reduced backlight to 20 and it's in user mode to reduce eye strain.2. Audio quality is good. You also need a lot of Tweeks though.Set it in movie preset if you're watching movies. This preset let's you hear all the music details also you'll hear the dialogues crystal clear. In this mode you won't hear bass that much. You'll get a hint of base nothing much. Because base will affect the Dialogues.Set it in music preset if you're listening to music in this preset you'll hear all the highs and lows crystal clear. You'll get bass as well.Okay now discuss about the consEverything else in this TV is a con.It has data saver installed but you can't able to access it. Data savers has an update in playstore. For some reason it's not updating.You can't use this TV as a Bluetooth speaker. You have to cast your phone screen in order to play your music on TV screen.Which brings a lot of problems. First you need a WiFi router with 2 GB data dedicated to this TV for casting only. Because it's using Chromecast not miracast. So what happens is, you are sharing your mobile screen to your TV using mobile data even though it's on same network. Which is stupid. Why in the world I have to spend my data to transfer the data packets using my router. It's on same network for god's sake.Also while casting if you open YouTube in your phone it opens YouTube app on tv, so you'll end up spending 3X data for playing YouTube video. ( For playing in mobile, for transferring data to tv and for the video playing on TV). But fellow competitors like mi TV also have built in Chromecast only. I don't know any budget TV which supports miracast, if you knew comment below to let me know.It can only access hard disc upto 2tb.Some apps like Udemy are not supported on this TV.You're going to spend more money on ott, let me explain how.. if you're going to use Netflix on TV you'll need premium subscription to add 2-4 devices at a time. Also if you have Airtel xstreme on your phone, and thinking I can use Airtel xstreme on tv.. you're wrong.. you need to purchase xstreme for TV as well.If you're rich enough to purchase all ott platforms and have enough money to spend 4gb / day data on TV on regular basis, you'll love this TV.Otherwise you're gonna end up hating this TV and yourself for purchasing this TV.I chose to purchase this TV because it's an Android TV, also home services during warranty period is free. I don't have to take this TV to the service centre, if there's something's wrong. After warranty period they charge ₹450 for the service. Which is cheaper than other brand.But if I knew I'm gonna get this for ₹16k I wouldn't even think about purchasing this TV. Because I got these picture and audio in my old Sansui LCD tv. Which lasted 5 years without any issues."

Okay that's fine it can happen with any product right? It took almost 2 months to get a service guy, that's also fine even though I had no entertainment at home because of the lockdown going on everywhere.All of sudden a service guy came like an angel and said I have to pay for the service as the board is burned it won't comes under their warranty policy. Great!I have been using a VU tv for the past 4 years that too got damaged but replaced with a brand new TV twice without even any questions asked. It was my great mistake I thought OnePlus would provide Quality products and Quality services. They just su*k."
2287,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Not that great,3.0,"The TV is an okay-ish buy.Don't come for the Brand here.I would happily suggest anyone to go with a Samsung or even Onida TV which does come at a nearby price point.The sound is low, but what to expect from a 20 Watt internal speaker.Even though it is back-lit with LED, there are certain points where you will not be able to see anything, it will be pitch black, while it should have been normal.And for the Game Mode, I used my PS4, XBOX ONE and Switch along with that. Played a couple of matches in Battlefield 1 and WWII. It reduces lag, but not upto a gaming level.The remote cannot start the tv all the time.It is slow when it comes to remote response, but that is only for the start up.But at this price point, what can one expect.And, at the time of writing this review, I had a serious issue a few days back, but the inputs from HDMI produced a grayscale output.I thought the TV was done for.But, it happens across all the OnePlus TV's it seems.If anyone has the same issue, reset the entire TV.I wasted some time with Amazon and OnePlus Care by scheduling repair services.But it was no good.All in all, I love One Plus, despite the negative points stated, the above has 2 stars for Amazon and 1 for the TV.If you want to try this one, gladly you are welcome, but I would suggest you to try another brand, specifically well established ones like Samsung or Sony or TCL or Onida."

2296,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Decent buy.. try better,3.0,"I have been using the 43 inch Y Series for over a week now.Pros - love the black tones, the tv itself is very aesthetic, latest Android loaded, all frequently used apps/programs available in the tv, the remote is very sleek and is Bluetooth enabled, no need to point remote to tv, the delivery and installation services were very quick and efficient.Cons - the OS laga, the build quality does not feel great, plastic body, doesn't work well with Alexa, sound quality is not great. The colours are not great either. Does not have different picture/colour modes. The biggest con for me is that it does not have adaptive display and gets too bright in low light while in standard settings.Overall - for the price of ₹22K - ₹23K the TV is totally worth buying. Remember that this is a budget tv. Premium TV's are almost double the cost."

   Alright, here is the new One Plus TV 43Y. You can watch Unboxing on my you tube channel X:Plorer!.I have been using this tv since a week now.Here are some pros and cons of the tv,Pros: Price, yes being a Indian we always seek products which are best quality with affordable price, It fits well.#Gift: Yes, you get Alexa Dot with OnePlus 43Y and 55 U TVs. Who don't like free stuff?#Picture Quality is super with baseless design of 88% of total view. Viewing angel will give you great experience.#Build Quality: I have been trying different TVs till now including Mi 55 inch, Iffalcon 43inch and other but trust me this One Plus is far ahead when it comes to design and quality material.Cons:#Sound: Yes it has 20wt output sound with Dolby Atmos but you won't feel bass.#RAM: It has 1GB RAM with internal storage of 8GB out of which only around 4 GB is useful. This would make operation lit slow.#Andoid oxygen play: It's hardly has watchable content and it's too old as there is Patch wall."

The picture and sound quality are not so great for a room of 100 sqft and there was a lot of glare even with less light in the room, tried all the suggestions on changing contrast/brightness etc., By looking at the hype, I expected a lot but this TV did not meet any of my expectations and left a disappointing experience."

No bass which is a huge disappointment.Alexa is not bundled, you need to add it separately during the purchase.@Amazon, when you mention that Alexa comes free with this purchase then make it bundled with the TV unit and do not ask Customers to add it separately during the purchase. Don't expect the Customers to add it separately during the Flash sale. This is simply cheating on the Customers."

Cuz it’s going to be like solving a puzzle what went wrong & what possibly can be right and after all of that the remote will give you a run which you never wanted.I can go on… but not worth my time.Just one thing if you think of buying CHEAP, you can opt for TCL instead but these are just junk covered with a shiny plastic and a good outlook."

Then I checked for other smart TVs and finally settled to purchase this OnePlus TV only because of the trust and experience I had on OnePlus products mainly mobile phones which me and my family are using.Believe me after receiving this TV I couldn't understand why people are so critical about this !! It serves all the purpose very well.. all smart features are excellent, connectivity is so good.. picture quality and sound is absolutely fine and sufficient for me. People complaint about its picture & sound quality but I found it amazing.. I don't expect any better clarity of picture than this TV.. and sound.. I couldn't use it on more than 10% volume in my 100 sq ft room. Guys It's just a TV, it could be bad, good or excellent.. for me it's Excellent.. I am not looking for a wife here.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣And people who are being so critical about this TV, I don't know what are they were expecting.. may be they are comparing this TV with a PVR screen, or its sound with a bose music system then definitely it's a below expectation product for you, sorry for your loss."

It's just been 23 days tht we bought it. It was all working fine and all of a sudden it shut down and we were unable to switch it on that too no body touched it or did anything.. How can this happen??? Quite surprised. .  I'd tried calling oneplus customer care, they're saying they won't be able to replace it since we'd purchased it from amazon..  And this seems to be too hectic to hear...  What's this amazon..  Never expected this... The quality of the service is pathetic..  Please don't buy it from amazon for their eye catching offers.  It always good to go n buy from their own website( I feel so)... If I would have done that then I would have got a replacement atleast....."

Which I realised after everything was setup.Overall the TV is good, picture quality is good not great but assuming the TV is for only Rs. 24000 I wasn’t expecting much.Sound again isn’t top notch but loud enough. You will have to customise the sound settings a bit or if you really want that sround sound kinda effect you may need to buy an additional sound bar.The remote connection is good, and everything else is fine."

I used a Samsung Smart TV before this and its output itself sounded as if it was from a home theatre but the same output from Oneplus was pathetic. I even tried all their settings and features available. I then ordered a JBL Infinity home theatre only for the sound thing and then connected it over Bluetooth. It was then beautiful and perfect. But after a couple of days there was a lag between the TV sound output and that from the Home theatre. I then replaced the JBL thing from Amazon and to my surprise found out that even the next one had a similar issue after a couple of days.I'm still worried if the Bluetooth feature of Oneplus TV has an issue or just my specific piece. This review of mine doesn't judge Oneplus TV at any side. It's just my experience. Other than the Bluetooth lag at some times, everything is at it's best and you can go for it without a second thought."

Iam not enforcing anyone.This is after 90days , I opened a ticket 2months back but till now there is no resolution.

Finally, I got a working product.After using it for 6 months, we were watching the TV suddenly it stopped working. I raised a complaint immediately. I waited for few days and started calling customer care. Every day, the phone will be attending by different executives they will tell theirs on stories. It will be assigned to Technician or the call with escalated to you will get a call back so and so... After a month and half the complaint got assigned to a technician and without visiting the site they told they have ordered for parts.During all this time, we were using our old TV. Good that we haven't sold.At last, they came the home with a TV and exchanged some parts with our TV. The TV is working.. but one issue. The TV display is coming opposite side. If we rotate the TV only we will be able to see. Now they told me there are no settings in the remote to change the direction. They will come with software to resolve this issue.  Again the service person came and tried to fix it but still, it's not resolved.Now they want to take the TV to service place and we have to get it from there. Not sure how much time it will take.This is my experience with the OnePlus TV. I would suggest don't go for this product.. If you still want to buy then arrange an alternative and be ready."

I recommend buying a soundbar3) does not power on by single click from remote.

(Those who have missed Echo Dot, I feel very sorry for them)Also Alexa worked me as a smart connector between TV and my Sony home theatre system, without any digital cables or converters ..! Saved my money there too..!!1. Picture Quality : Is pretty good and 1080i LED display. Viewing angle should be straight and if it’s more than 30degree picture clarity will reduce and colours starts fading. Make sure you are straight infront of TV view.2. Sound Quality : is ok kind of Quality at this price as I am depending more on home theatre speakers, thus it’s good for me.3. Value for money : yes definitely you can choose at this budget unless like other brands of this range and it’s 43”.5.chromecasting is built-in, can avail from IOs platform too as I am using it..!4. Includes all the modern smart tv features like Netflix, amazon,YouTube and google assistants in one single button. But some time-lag can be experienced while changing the input sources.Even google assistance is bit slow to catch-up when compared to Alexa..!Overall I can give  ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️Thanks Team Oneplus and Amazon.in"

Else the speakers of 10w each are very low in volume..a good movie with sound effects cant be enjoyed at all..else this tv is highly recommended. All the features works perfectly as the company says in ads. Value for money indeed.One update after using the tv for 1.5 month-1.

Features are also impressive. But the rigidity of the TV is questionable.Installation Service by One Plus was very poor. The installation was scheduled between 2-6pm and they reached around 6.30pm and left around 8.45pm. The Fixed wall mount used was in rusted condition. And they drilled total 5 holes on the TV Mounting board for 4 screw!! and the Wooden board got damaged. The TV was tilted to one side after installation and then they had to use small paper pieces to level the TV ! For the fixed TV mount the charge was rs 500 even though the charge written in amazon is rs 299 for a 43"" TV!!"

The picture quality and sound quality is very poor comparing with his TV. The remote control and voice recognition is perfect. But the clarity of display is very bad according to MI TV. Till the reviewing date there is no inbuilt apps for screen casting,etc. We should seperatly want to download Airscreen app from play store. For installing other apps this TV not have file manager to download apk from USB, we should also want to download that from play store. I am damn sure that My friends MI TV is better than oneplus TV. My rating to this TV is 2.5/5.Not worth this TV for 12,999.better go for MI tv or other brands like tcl, realme, etc. I think that Oneplus will overall these products, but in case of TV till I am putting the review MI TV is good by comparing with my friends TV."

   This review is in usage of 9 months. Worst product from OnePlus. I just don't even understand why they had to come into TV. My personal opinion always go with Sony or LG. It is the best.2nd time issue with the display.First issue arrived after 4 months I bought the TV. Same as you see in the picture. (This image is second time issue)But it was working for 30 mins and it started to fade away. I usually don't use the TV much so I didn't care about it for 2 months. Then it started to fade forever. So had to book a service. Nonsense in this pandemic. It took 2 months to fix.Fine atleast some picture to see in the second lockdown after the service. And it didn't like to work after 1 month after the 1st service. Same kind of issue. This image is reference after 1st service done to display. (Changing the whole display).I personally recommend Sony of LG. They are best in TVs. Ofcourse they are high priced for what reason you guys might think. This is the reason.These guys, I just don't understand why did I even step foot in these kinds of company's for a different product. They are utter waste of time and money. I have used the TV only for 6 months. That's it.And I'm in second services with one year.Bullshit what others think about this TV or the brand. Shame to say I'm oneplus user for 7 years now.Cheap quality displays they use. So is the lowest price."

2339,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Budget TV BUT NOT GREAT,5.0,Pixel quality is ok. You can easily notice it with different colours. Using android enabled smart tv hence have same emotions like the way android works or probably the function processing capability of the tv is not at par. Tv Remote sensor works only in you are in range of 2 metres irrespective of inserting battery cells. I feel my Tata sky remote sensor was out of the world since it use to capture signals from any corner of the room where my old tv was installed.Piece of advise if you money to spend go for another brand or device altogether and you limited on budget I would recommend you to with this tv

Because of this internet connection through our wifi router is not connected even though other devices get connected with same wifi network. When I do the warranty claim, after three or four visits, either Oneplus or authorized service personal(Amazon itself) cannot find the solution. So every time we switch ON TV we need to set date and time for proper internet connectivity. Otherwise it will work like a normal LED TV only not smart TV. You cannot use any app installed or you cannot install any new apps. Think before buying this TV as this involves big risk. I am writing this review after using the TV for last one month. No response for replacement from either side."

Raised the issue with Amazon on 27th and still waiting for some service centre person to pick my call and attend to the problemDissapointing

To switch on the tv, I need to try Atleast 10 times. And if it still does not work, I need to manually switch on the tv by pressing the button behind TV. I really like the One Plus brand but, TV definitely is not up to the mark. Can't handle the lag sometimes. It's very frustrating after paying so much money and can't do anything when the remote does not work. I'm sure I definitely can use connect feature on my One Plus mobile phone as remote, but what's the TV remote for when it does not do what it is supposed to do."

One of the worst TV's I have ever seen. Avg display, Avg sound. Doesn't switch on as soon as I power on from the remote, need to press at least 2-3 times to switch on TV.  There's a lot of lag for volume buttons. Sometimes TV itself goes to home page from live TV and doesn't go back to live TV, need to switch off TV and switch it on again. After 1 month of usage TV hanged up a few times. The TV even doesn't connect to OnePlus connect app. Need to find TV on mobileapp for so much time, sometimes even after many trails I can't connect to my TV. Even opening and closing apps is very laaagggggyyyyy."

2366,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Poor Display and worst after Sales service,1.0,"I bought this TV based on my experience with One plus Phone. Contrary to the quality of the phones, the TV quailty has proven to be nightmare for me. On top of that their service is poor. The option to register complaint through Amazon gives no result. 1st the display was not proper, after complaining they took two months to change the display. The new display lasted only 10 days and now its completely black screen with few colored lines. Its been 10 days, I have raised complaint to both Amazon and One plus directly but all in vain. I will not recommended this TV to anyone. I have two more TVs at my home (both Samsung), never faced any such issue. Samsung has the same price and same features. I wish I can replace it for Samsung.....and now its the third time that the TV is down, 3rd time in warranty period"

2369,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Consider the trade-off involved before buying it,3.0,"Like the title of my review said, I am going to only list down the factual pros and cons after a day of using the TV elaborately and let you decide for yourself.Pros-Great picture quality, especially if content is in HD-The smart TV features that allows you to pair it with your phone, laptop, bluetooth speakers, bluetooth headphones, etc. are super handy-The screen size of 43"" is just perfect for your room unless it is ultra spaciousCons-The sound. 20W is loud enough, but the quality is really poor and one-dimensional so you will surely need an external sound system or sowaker-The finishing of the product is not the best. One can tell how OnePlus managed to price this at 25k when you pay attention to how they've cut corners on the quality. The OnePlus logo on the front is titled (first time I've ever seen this on a product from a reputed brand). There's a considerable gap between the display and top corner bezels, and the plastic finishing isn't even-There's a lag when you're operating the TV (switching between apps, browsing content, and giving Google assistant voice commands) 50% of the time. Hoping OnePlus fixes it with future software updates but so far there's no official word on thatThose are my pros and cons in a nutshell, now the decision is yours"

2378,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),A good product for the price range! But disappointed on Oneplus:(,3.0,"Reviewing after using the product for a month.*Picture quality is awesome. It will beat many other competitors in this price range but not that great as boasted in the launch event.*Sound Quality is average. But you have to make some changes in the settings to get a good sound output. But compared to Motorola and realme tv in this price range, it'll lose. In this TV to get a good sound output, you have to max the volume.*Software is the point where I got disappointed from one plus. I expected many things because it's a TV from Oneplus. The TV lags a little bit. Control from the TV remote takes 1-2 seconds for the TV to operate. I hope one plus gives a good proper update to clear this problem.*Ram is 1gb and the storage is 8gb out of which the available is 3.6gb. Motorola has 4.6gb of free space. So a little disappointment but it's a TV after all not a smartphone.* Input ports works fine and u won't get a 3.5mm port.*Opening an app takes some time which is a little irritating.*As said about the Oneplus connect app, it's not that hype what you saw during the launch event. One annoying thing is you have to open a oneplus connect app from the TV and then you can use it from your smartphone. Typing option is not available.* Sometimes the TV doesn't open YouTube. Have to restart the TV and then open YouTube.If Oneplus is seeing this Review I expect you to solve the software issue regarding the lag which annoys a lotOne more thing I couldn't connect Alexa to this TV.Also I couldn't connect Google remote.Overall it's a good budget TV. But it's not that buttery smooth. If the software issue is solved then this TV will be a great budget TV.I hope my review helps you."

As a manufacturer, OnePlus should ideally honour warranty replacements especially when the product is less than 24 hours old and faulty right out. If you're buying this, be warned that OnePlus support is super apathetic and you'll probably be left fending for yourself.TV is fine(ish) as a product, nothing exceptional. It's rife with software bugs and lags -- can't even download apps because they all get stuck on ""pending"". Go for an Amazon FireTV, a non-smart TV with a fire stick, an Apple TV, or just assemble one yourself - you'll have a better experience than with this garbage product and company."

   I am writing this review after 4 days of useI was excited for the one plus tv as I have 4 OnePlus devices in my home and I am extremely satisfied with all of then .But as soon as the TV got installed I noticed that the App icons in the onelus UI were blur( I could see the pixels distorted). I asked the the installation guy if it was some settings issue. He tried to fix it and said that it is like that onlyI compared it with my other FHD TV( MI 4A pro) and there was a major difference.* after 2 days the OS started lagging very much* Startup takes minimum 30 sec* The voice recognition is very bad* The Chromecast is worse ( it lags as hell that you can't even understand a single word)* Chromecast keep failing when tried to connect with laptop*The OnePlus connect app has a 5 sec delay* The picture quality is that bad You can see the screen distorting in wallpapers.Even after so many defects both Amazon and Oneplus has declined my refund saying that it is a quality issue and no refund would be provided for the same."

For this thing when I escalated issues even on Twitter as well amazon said contact the one plus directly we can not help. So, till now Nothing is done in this case and after August they will say product is not in Warranty period.

May be smallest size in 32 inch segment.There are few negative review about it's panel quality on YouTube, which is deliberately made by one reviewer it seems. All other experts have appraised this product.ConsThakes few seconds to load as 32 inch tv mostly comes with 1gb ram.

2401,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Worst Brand with worst Product Service. Think twice before you purchase OnePlus T.V from Amazon,1.0,"The Product came faulty out of the box. Within two months of purchase there were visible lines and blacked out picture when connected to a set top box.So finally one day the product decided to quit with no picture but just RGB lines on display. See for the details in shared pic.Now coming to the service part. It's been almost 3months since I am trying to get it serviced or repaired by Amazon(product support agency). Well it is a new year now still no luck.The customer care executives are a bunch of fools with no remors of your problem. Their constant jab is wait for 48hrs problem will be resolved. They provide you with all sorts of misinformation regarding their product support. One told me it will be fulfilled by ONEPLUS,Honestly oneplus don't give a flying duck' about customer or later in product support. With multiple calls and false promises, I called back Amazon Cs, this is when I came to know the product and service will be done by Amazon. Anyway after multiple calls and escalations till date no one visited. An engineer was scheduled to visit while he didn't and contacted me via call and asked me to click picture of the problem and send me via whatsapp. After looking upon it he told me it's a manufacturing defect and will be replaced at the earliest. Well later received a mail from Amazon stating support has been cancelled.So the moral of the story is,THE STRUGGLE IS REAL.Purchase One plus at your own risk.Don't trust Amazon for any service related query."
2402,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Good picture quality.. nice tv brought it at Rs 21499 last year Aug 2020,5.0,Very good picture quality enjoying watching movies. Sound quality require some improvement. Easy to connect with app. Very good installation service.Lots of one start in review are due to not getting Alexa offer and faulty products and installation service.Regarding Alexa they mentioned it's free or on less price but as there routine offer it's not kept easily available u have to check and add offer in u r cart which is not expected from amazon. It heart's if you buy product and not got offered Alexa. So my sincere request to amazon if u are willing to give any offer keep it easy and don't hide it. Else didn't give what we are getting in this price One ➕ Tv we are happy.Thanks

   I bought OnePlus 32 Y series smart TV on 16 Sep 2020 and during the initial usage I felt like this was the best grab for the price because Oneplus gives its superior build quality and smart features and everything seems to be fine for first 2 months.Literally everything was good .But after two months of usage the TV suddenly started showing display issues , such as change in colour , flickering etc and this issue disappears when the TV is  RESTARTED . Again this issue started appearing on random basis and goes when restarted.So when this happened multiple times I myself recorded a video and pictures  of the same and contacted amazon for the service.Believe me this is where it all started to become worser. The technician visited my home and confirmed it that the TV is having manufacturing defect as it doesn't have any physical damage.From then it almost took 2 months of continued followup with amazon customer care to solve my issue. The issue was escalated multiple time and still was not resolved. I talked with superior associate still they also couldn't solve my issue ,at last after multiple complaints and escalation on priority basis and to management level , they had to accept the return as an exception.OnePlus brand didn't meet the expectations in its TV."

I ignored the reviews while purchasing the product stating there are lot of glitch in the tv software. I thought those glitches would go after the update. But it didn't happen.

   This TV is not great or not worst.I liked the picture quality in this range and bezel less view is awesome.(attached picture)However, not having aux support is minus. Sound quality of TV is poor. Poor and loud sound doesn't help.And recently I've found a dead pixel on the screen, of which I've attached the picture. Technician came and checked it. Received an update saying waiting for warranty part. Will update how everything went once anything is done.Updating on 30/10/2020-> Received replacement part-> Received part was replaced to TV with original one-> Executive messed it up and TV is not showing true colors now. To say it is showing negative like colors-> Looking trust on amazon day by day.->Chatted with agent called Seizel who is stubborn and not at all listening.-> Rescheduled a service appointment.-> Will see what will happen and update here.Will not recommend this product strongly. Overall so so experience."
2417,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"Good TV given the price, Sound and Speed could be better",4.0,"Like the TV overall. Good picture quality and software interface. I would recommend it. However, I feel the following could have been done differently:1. The sound quality isn't all that impressive. The speakers aren't loud enough. I'm using additional speakers with my TV.2. The processor used is quite slow. I see apps hanging at times which forces me to reboot the TV.3. The setup process wasn't very smooth. When I first started the TV, I couldn't install or update apps. I had to reset the TV to get the play store working.4. I can't find a way to boot the TV to the home screen. It directly boots to the live TV interface. I don't have cable or set-top box so this doesn't make sense to me. If there is a way, I haven't been able to find out how yet after searching a lot online.5. The base of the TV doesn't feel stable. One has to take a lot of care if one wants to move the TV.6. It's very inconvenient that the ports in the center especially because of point #5 if your TV is on the table. This makes it hard to access the ports. We have to move the TV to access the ports and #5 makes it difficult. The ports should have been placed on the side. Since USB is the port I'll be using the most, I got around the problem by purchasing a USB cable that I can access without moving the TV.I went for the 43in TV instead of the 55in one just because I don't have place to keep the larger 55in TV. If you have place for the 55in TV and if it fits into your budget, I would recommend going for that one. It would have been nice if OnePlus offered a 43in TV with all the 55in features for a slightly higher price than the current 43in TV."

Very low quality build material cheaper.2. Hanging, restarting problem when you switching between app.3. Google Assistant not working since I update the Android version.4.  Sound quality is the biggest setback, it sounds like a 3rd rate speaker and sound isn't balanced. There is no clarity in the sound, you won't be able to comprehend no matter what is playing on screen.5. Frame of TV isn't durable, it seems like the screen will fall off the frame at any minute.6. Remote is very slow. It takes time and you have to proper focus infront of tv.Bad policy of amazon.Technician from oneplus visit to solve but failed, technician from amazon come two time for inspection failed to solve. they are not able to do anythingSo, I will not suggest to purchase oneplus TV a lot of problems."

2427,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Value for Money,4.0,"Back in July 2020, OnePlus launched its budget TVs line up. I prebooked the TV on the launch day itself. After around two weeks, the TV went on flash sale for the first time. I received the TV after a week. I got the TV for around Rs.20,000. I prebooked the device for Rs 1000, which gave me two years extended warranty and Rs 1000 amazon cashback. Also, I got Amazon Echo Dot for free and a TV which I returned and got a refund for the same. It was a great deal, and so I decided to go for the OnePlus TV.With an excellent price tag, it comes with some exciting features like OnePlus Connect, Dolby Audio Enhancement, Oxygen Play, Chromecast, Google Assistant built-in and compatible with Amazon Alexa. I was very much excited to unbox and try the OnePlus TV. It also comes with Android 9.0. Unboxing the TV and attaching the table mount was an easy process. Also, setting up the device was very easy.Initial Impressions:When I first started the device, it was lagging a lot. However, there was already a software update available when I just started the device. I quickly updated the device, and the TV was still not working smooth enough. I think going 1 GB RAM is not enough. The picture quality is impressive, and the sound quality isn’t good at default settings. After tweaking the sound, it sounded terrific. Regarding connectivity, it was very smooth. The bezel-less design was the most attractive part of the TV.Design:The design is the most decisive point of the TV. It comes with a bezel-less display, an 88.5% screen to body ratio, and an enhanced viewing experience. It is slim from the back of the TV. Also, the ports are accessible quite easily. The table mount is also of decent quality, and there is a LED indicator in the bottom right corner of the TV. Overall, I loved the design and form factor of the TV.Rating: 4.5/5.Display:The display comes with a bunch of fancy features. It comes with a 1080p resolution and has DCI-P3 93% provides excellent colour reproduction. It uses Gamma Engine for picture enhancement and has features like Anti-Aliasing, Noise Reduction, Dynamic Contrast and colour space mapping. It also comes with various display tweaks such as sports mode, movie mode and many others. But I just tweaked them to get the best out of the TV. The default settings aren’t as good as expected. After tweaking, the colours and overall picture quality is soothing. Although, I think the 60fps doesn’t look smooth enough. It seems like 30-40 fps. To sum up, the display is excellent at this price point, although you need to tweak the settings to get the best out of the display.Rating: 4/5Sound:It comes with a 20W speaker output and also supports Dolby Audio Enhancement. The default sound settings aren’t sounding that great. After tweaking the audio settings, it works at its best. It is loud enough and no complaints apart from default settings.Rating: 4/5Connectivity:We get all the required connectivity options. It comes with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, Ethernet, RF Connection Input, HDMI Input, AV Input, Digital Audio Output and USB Ports. And the most legendary feature is the OnePlus Connect. We can control the TV entirely using a phone, take screenshots of the TV and save and share it. You can also control the TV actions such as volume, switch input, open apps, and turn off TV using Amazon Echo Dot. But there is an issue with the remote. TV won't power on-off-on the first attempt. It also doesn’t have a dedicated input switch button.Rating: 3/5Pros:1)  Awesome colour accuracy, DCI-P3 93% and beautiful display quality.2)  Great sound quality with features like Dolby Audio Enhancement, Dialogue Enhancer, Dolby Surround etc3)  OnePlus Connect App features like taking TV Screenshots, controlling TV etc.4)  Aggressive price point.5)  Amazon Echo Dot integration and Google Assistant Built-In.6)  Bezel-Less display enhances the viewing experience.Cons:1)  It lags a lot at times and especially after turning on the TV from sleep mode.2)  TV won't power on the first attempt 90% of the times.3)  Default Audio and Display Settings aren’t the best.4)  1 GB RAM isn’t enough for the TV.5)  No Wall Mount inside the box.6)  No input switch button on the remote."

We generally use only 5% volume in my 12x15 size drawing room.👉🏼 Set top box - Existing Airtel DTH SD set top box gives good video quality, so we don't feel to upgrade to HD set top box.👉🏼 Streaming performance - Superb. My kid watches YouTube 80% of the time in a day. FHD Video streaming is superb in YouTube premium with my You Broadband 50 Mbps Wifi network.👉🏼 Bluetooth - Sometimes my kid uses Bluetooth Handsfree while watching TV, especially in afternoon when everyone in home are sleeping except him. Sound quality even in bluetooth is awsome, without any relay.👉🏼 I had bought Mi & One plus both 32"" TV on same day for 2 homes from Amazon.

The display looks good for this price range2. Really good if you are using this as a secondary display for your laptop3. Sound quality is promising4. Picture color quality is comparatively goodBad:1. Lags when you use any of the inbuilt apps. Specially Prime, Disney+Hotstar, YouTube, etc.,2. Sometime it automatically switch from HDMI mode to home screen3. Freeze during the normal operation4. Turning on with the remote is a biggest challenge and frustrating. Never found the easy way to do it, so started using the manual power button5. Switch off the TV if not in use, or else it will turn on automatically and spoil your sleep"
2438,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"Not recommended to purchase,poor screen & Sound quality.",1.0,I have bought One plus Tv as I was very much happy with one plus brand after using the one plus 7 phone.I was badly disappointed with the product. Thanks to amazon as they took the unit return back and refunded the money.I want to tell separately about the bad experiences:1. Picture quality: It was sometime too bright and sometimes too dull. Screen was blue & green sometimes as you see in the attached image.2. HDMI Port was faulty.Sound Quality: quality of the sound was like cheap speakers used in the TV unit.Overall Comment: Not up to the expectations. Not recommended to purchase.
2439,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Please don't fall pray to this TV. Better go for other brands,1.0,After 15 days of usage I see the product works too slow.The picture quality is fine. After switching on the TV we can expect the response only after 1-2 minutes. That in my opinion a waste to buy. Normal smart or android tv work faster than OnePlus.Sound is satisfactory.Google voice search doesn't work.Couldn't add OnePlus account to the TV.OnePlus connect ( using OnePlus mobile as remote) looks like a joke or silly app to use because that doesn't work and connect well with OnePlus mobile.Do not waste time waiting for the sale.
2440,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Sound and Sytem Software is Pathetic.,3.0,I am writing this review after using this tv for 5 months and I received two updates in 5 months. Tv picture quality is amazing you get the best viewing experience but sound and it's android is pathetic. From starting I see lags in this TV and I thought it get resolved after updates but it's not resolved yet. Syetem interface is really slow. If you're planning to buy this tv go for upper one plus TV not this one.
2441,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),#neversettle... Oneplus,5.0,Picture quality.. AmazingRemote control.. Very soft speedy oprationSound quality.. Quite dispointed but not bad for 43 inches tv.Overall oneplus is best as other comparative.I am used oneplus mobile from last 6 years.Only amezon service was very bad not customer supportive.
2442,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Most worst product of 1+ from amazon and worst CC with worst service,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   This is after 1 week of usage watch attached video, After speaking to Amazon Customer care they have assigned some Amazon service agent. The agent said he will fix the issue but even after 2 months there is no resolution to my issue. Never expected such a worst service from Amazon purchase. Even after reaching to 1+ CC, they said they will sendsome technician, but till now after 20 days no one reached. I request who ever see this review never ever purchase from Amazon site & 1+ products.I'll give -5 rating"
2443,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Defective product & Amazon NOT providing Warrenty claim,1.0,"TV screen is defective after using 6 months. And Amazon is not providing warrenty claim for the TV. Upon raising service request, Amazon mark it completed without any technician. I suggest not to buy this product from Amazon because you will not get any warrenty claim if product is defective. One year warranty claim is fake, Amazon is not providing any warrenty claim. Don't buy from Amazon."
2444,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Value for money,5.0,Tv is absolutely value proposition. All required features are in the tv. If you have a one plus phone then its a quick sync for first time installation.Dislike- does not come with a wall mount stand & the hd cable requirement is a 2.0 cable... These offset you by an additional amount depending on what you add on..Also you need to proactively call the installation guys as they were not aware of my installation job...
2445,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Feedback on oneplus TV,1.0,Guys please don't buy oneplus TV and it's not a good product. We bought a new TV(3 Months old) and now it's not working now. I have called the support and written back and forth emails but no support. It's a worst support which I have never seen till today. Go for the MI or Samsung.
2446,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Did not live upto the Brand's name. Don't buy it,1.0,User interface is good. Sound quality is poor. Have to use external speakers for clear sound. Better options are available in this price range.Edit: After using the TV for 4 months. I have downgraded my rating form two to one star. Bluetooth connectivity is very poor. You get delayed response. The screen has started bleeding. Already have a bright line on the screen which is spreading with each passing day. Worst TV in this budget. Don't buy it. Go for other options.
2447,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),"BAD PRODUCT, PATHETIC SERVICE.",1.0,"NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.I bought this product in October and the installation date given was 1 month later. Yet the technician had no mood to install it. Further, the Television worked fine for 3 months and one fine day its screen display went dark. We thought it was a Tata sky set talk box issue but later the other hdmi slot also went dark... I have been calling amazon every single day to provide a warranty repair... but for the past fifteen days they are not able to arrange a technician to visit us. I'm fed up calling and explaining the issue again and again. I'm now looking for a refund r else i will be forced to go to the consumer forum."
2448,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Remote Control Not Working...,1.0,"Total Waste of money. Got the tv in flash sale and in only 1 month remote control stopped working. Asked for technical support, the Amazon guy came for inspection and found the remote control faulty and told that it will get replaced but did not get any replacement till date.  Neither Amazon is responding properly neither one plus is responding. Will suggest buying some other product from a local vendor to get support on an immediate basis."

Unfortunately no one turned up till date & giving lame excuses.I'm surprised if I have been treated like this within product warranty what I'll do after warranty exhausted.One plus Customer care is pathetic a major cause of concern please don't ignore this.Tv has couple of technical issue while mapping with other external device like lan, Bluetooth & all."
2455,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Good quality nuder the price. Bad installation service.,4.0,Pros: Excellent picture quality. Voice quality is good but needs go to settings and do setup to genre you watching. I set it to sports for everything. I bought it in annual sale and it is nice prodct under this price.Cons: No bootup sound or beep when powered on or used remote so you have to press remote quite hard. Takes good 1-1.5minuts to boot up.Overall verdict - Satisfied with the picture quality and sound quality of product. Could use a notification sound to save my remote though.Amazon installation service is not great as they force you to purchase wall mount stand and charge the installation.  Also the TV was delivered on time but it sat there over the weekend as the installation person could only come after 2days. Moreover they void your warranty if you go for DIY installation or setup which is pretty easy to do. Strange from amazon.
2456,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Software glitches need improvement,3.0,Picture and sound quality are good but occasional glitches with respect to frozen or slow response while content surfing. This needs tv to be restarted to make it smooth again. My mitv which is slightly cheaper works flawlessly in this aspect and OnePlus has a lot to improve via software update maybe
2457,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Worst Service,1.0,"I wish I had read the review’s on oneplus official facebook page. 99% people are complaining about the service providing by one plus.Now let me share what happens with me:I bought this TV through amazon with amazon and one plus brand warranty. Now I am facing some issues with my TV. I called the amazon service to fix my tv and I called them many many times and no one visit at my home to fix the tv ( to let you know I am living in Delhi-NCR not himalayas) so when amazon is failed to do that they escalated my request to oneplus and now it’s more than a month I am still calling them to fix my tv and every time they said we escalated your request to related department kindly wait for 3 days to visit the technician, and after 3 days you called they again saying the same thing again and again. it’s really frustrating.So I SUGGEST DON’T GO WITH ONE PLUS TV"

2461,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Hidden installation charges for wall mounting,4.0,"The installation executive charged me Rs. 300/- cash for wall mounting brackets since they are not included in the price of the TV. This information should have been clearly mentioned on the product description but it was not!Also, initially I was very disappointed with the sound output of the TV. The installation executive said that this is the best possible. But later when I adjusted the sound settings from the menu the sound output increased dramatically."
2462,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Very very Worst product and waste customer support,1.0,LED TV / Y series 32Y1 / TV worked 1ly for 7 days / contacting customer care for more than 1 and half month / no one came to repairI bought this one plus LED TV this 20th October 2021 through amazon. The worked properly only for 7 days. then display stopped working only audio is coming. Since then I am contacting customer care regularly everytime they say within next 36 to 48 hours technician will contact me. But no one contacted me. I asked phone number of technician but they say they don't have. For past one and half month I am contacting customer care for more than 8 times still same reply but nothing was done. my location is urban area only. selling very poor quality TV is one thing. They can't even provide repair services in urban area.Very very worst product don't even think of buying it.
2463,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),please read the technical details before buying,1.0,it's a old model tv you cannot get dual band frequency o. the tv and if you need to do any this with picture quality the you will need to stop the movie and then go to service to resolve the issues other brand tv have better features than this old technology
2464,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Stay away from this TV,3.0,"The TV's composite input went bad in less than a month of usage. Registered a complaint on the oneplus support site. No response since then, no calls, emails or texts from OnePlus support. The visit date has come and gone and I have tried various methods to contact OnePlus support (email, call, chat) without success.The TV quality is below average: there is a grey ghosting when the screen is perfectly black even on the android bootup screen, sound is extremely poor (I can never get rid of a boom in the TV speakers) and the TV does not respond to the remote half the time.My advice: Go for a well known brand with better service network. It may cost more, but you will be happier in the long run. If you are on a budget, look for other cheaper brands. OnePlus just does not have the quality assurance or the service network in place for their TVs.Update: after I posted the above review I called OnePlus support. I had on hold waiting for a rep for a very long time (close to 15 minutes I think), but finally got through. The service person guided me through doing a reset of the TV and to my surprise it fixed the composite input issue. I also think the sound has improved a bit. So the software appears to be a little buggy, but the TV is in usable state now."

Good decent picture quality for the money one spends on it. Can't expect clarity like expensive one on this. Now the down sides of this android TV.1. The sound quality is bad, dialogues can't be heard sometimes and you really have to crank up the volume to an irritable level.2. Remote is definitely not the most responsive of the lot.

   Don't buy this TV. Worst experience. Bought it only 4 months back when it was launched. But now the screen display is flickering and stuttering. The OnePlus service team is so poor that they could not even respond properly. Oneplus may be a good brand for high end mobiles but not for any other consumer goods. I just want some technician to arrive at my place to sort the issue out. No one is responding properly. Service team sets a bad example for OnePlus. Oneplus service team is not like for samsung or any other big brands. Their network is so small that they can't provide the service on time and in many areas."

Light weight and easy to use.It is so light that I have to go to the warehouse to pick that up because the delivery person says he can't come to deliver. And he was okay if I complain. I got the TV after almost 10 days when it had reached the warehouse. And the best part the delivery team were not even concerned about it. I just walked in after so much frustration and picked the tv and then I got a msg on my phone saying Your order is out for delivery. I hope Amazon does take some action.

Upon a lot of convincing my Dad finally trusted a One Plus TV as he is traditionally a fan of Samsung, Panasonic and other ""established"" TV's. The One Plus TV not only has impressed him but the prompt installation and customer support has helped increase his faith in an otherwise ""new"" company. Coming to the TV the picture quality is amazing and the voice recognition along with Alexa works like a charm. Despite many negative reviews on the sound quality I found it satisfactory and absolutely upto the mark. I DONT NEED ANY EXTERNAL SPEAKERS as the sound quality is DAMN GOOD.

Always made false reporting, always rescheduling and cancelling visit appointments and even after then just updating ""waiting for parts"" I thank Amazon who accepted return of my television in January 2021 and till 9th March 2021 he was making false reporting; ultimately i told him about my return of television and he ended the service ...... I HAVE TO SURRENDER A GOOD TELEVISION (just a small defect) BECAUSE OF THE PATHETIC SERVICE.  Later I purchased Hisense 43A71F from FLIPKART with 3 years complete protection plan of flipkart ( my OnePlus tv also had a extended warranty/ protection policy) . I changed TV brand and purchase app just because of this service..... I hope this feedback will take some measures which will benefit your future customers!"
2486,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),You must go with OnePlus y series tv .😅,3.0,"OnePlus is a brand what i know , it gives premium quality product ,but in this y series tv of 32 inches  ,its not upto the mark  , i will rate by its performance 3/5 , product it good but performance is not upto the mark if i compare to MI 4 tv as in same segment , infact its performance is comparatively more better than oneplus tv , .Issues what i am facing1. When you will power on the tv. First it shows blue screen for 3-5 seconds ,i don't kniw why .2. Performance is low it tooks overall 20 second to start completely.3. While give indication to power on by your remote you will not to know ,is it actually on or off because it takes around 3-5 second to show response .4. If you are restless person then this tv is not for you ,i recomend personal .5.but all these software kind of issue ,it may be resolved over updated maybe ,but for now i dont want to go with this oneplus y series tv . I am not 100 percent satisfied.Or next its your call whether you want to go with this product or not . OnePlus is a good brand but this y series may bring it down."

Fully satisfiedAudio: audio is ok for one single room and ya ofcourse Dolby sound is also working niceDesign: bazzle less design will attracts attention while tv is ON or OFF, it looks very good like a modern smart TVCons:1. Vertical line on screen:After 6 months of use i got single vertical line on screen which is very disappointing for a brand One Plus, Tv was ideal on Wall and one day i saw a vertical line next day i got 3 lines and now as you can see in the picture there are 6 bold lines on the screen.I have called to customer care and no response after 1 week.2. Remote voice command is not working from very first day of installation but that was ok in front of screen fault.3. You have to pay 300 Rs as a installation charge for 32inch TV"

Picture quality is not so great.3. TV gets hang in all the applications.4. It'll go back to initial screen while you are watching something.5. Sometimes it works as radio you play some video but u can only hear it and entire screen will become blank 😑6. Amazon warranty claim service is pathetic, I've raised a request and waited for 5 days still no technician had visited from OnePlus to provide service and amazon doesn't have any information regarding that, simply they offer this service"

Now I have wait for 25 days to technician to come and inspect.Brand value of ONEPLUS in mobile category is GOOD , When it comes to TV , ONEPLUS made a scarp product.

2495,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Pathetic feelings.,1.0,I had ordered this tv as a gift for my sister. After 15 days their is a black line appear on the screen and after some hour whole screen became black and nothing can be seen on the screen. Now we can only hear the sound with this tv. Because it happens after 15 days so Amazon refused to give us replacement and suggest us to contact with OnePlus. Now OnePlus taking its own time to decide whether they will give me a new replacement or they will repair this crap. Don't know how much time they will take?
2496,OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD LED Smart Android TV 43Y1 (Black) (2020 Model),Not Smart at all,1.0,We faced a lot of issue with the TV. Everything related to tv is good but the smart part really is disappointing. We have to wait 1-2 minutes before the TV turns on. Google assistant is not responsive most of the time. Not a smooth experience. And just for reference my internet speed is 200 mbps.Will recommend you all buy a normal TV and use amazon firestick instead. Firestick is smarter than the smart TV by one plus.

   Purchase this during Amazon sale for my room and it’s an excellent TV. Have been using it for more than a month now and there have been not any issues such.Pros:1. Amazing clarity2. Amazing sound for a small room3. Chrome cast or casting works neatly4. All the apps work extremely fine.5. The Bluetooth remote is extremely good and there is a knack to use this - it gets switched off due to inactivity so if you want to quickly turn on your TV you’ll have to press on the power on button twice with a gap of 3 to 4 seconds in between.Cons:1. There is a lag while starting the TV and some apps.2. Voice recognition take some time.Lags do happen because you’re paying not a big price for a TV like this which is feature loaded so I feel this is worth the Buy!"

I pre ordered it on the first day itself. But later I've realised that it was the biggest mistake. The OnePlus trademark of quality doesn't applicable on the this Y-Series. It feels like they have just put OnePlus logo on some cheap quality TV. I'm getting regular issues with the TV. If I claim for service the person comes and resets the TV and says everything it good and after 3-4 days same issue happens. 1st Issue: The screen went blank and only audio came without video. 2nd Issue: Video stuck and audio continues and remote doesn't work. 3rd Issue: Sometimes Remote doesn't work. 4th: There is some little gap in between the outside panel and the screen and when I showed it to the service person he says it is normal due to sensors present that gap is visible.but there is no sensor present in the middle. 5th: User interface sucks. 6th: Bluetooth connectivity issue. Multiple times I reported and the service person comes and resets the TV and leave.  7th: Connectivity b/w TV and remote is the worst. All the time the TV sucks. Do not go for it. If you want a 32"" TV in the budget go for MI or RealMe. OnePlus Y series is worst in the entire OnePlus lineup."

Its software is very laggy and buggy with bugs which are never fixed. It might receive software updates but the bugs are still there every time. If you turn the tv off with remote, it turns on again on its own. Sometimes you have to press the power button several times to turn it on. If you switch between apps extensively it gets slowed down and lags till you restart it. Takes several seconds to power on.Overall, it has bad speakers and bad software. Display is good but you have to tweak it a bit because it is so saturated. So, spend some more money and don't buy this product."

First if you want to buy this item u should have prime membership first condition2. After becoming the ""prime member"" TV is delivered after seven days it's a joke from Amazon and it shows that  they don't take their prime members  seriously3. And I have to wait for 10 Freaking days for insatallation4. Then that insatallation guy really he is a fraud he charged me 800 rupees for wall mount and before coming for installation he asked  there is two wall mount one is local of 400 rupees and another one is from one plus of  800 rupees so I choose the 800 one which is from one plus which is doubt full.5. One plus should add wall mount barcket in the box so these fraud installation guy can't receive any one  after Amazon doesn't take the liability of this they said that this is  the genuine price and I  doubt it because he didn't bring the wall mount bracket in retail box and making excuse that he don't have enough space in his bag .6. This is  the first time I am  buying anything from Amazon and I buy disappointem not a tv  from Amazon again thanks Amazon for this shipment experience .7.
